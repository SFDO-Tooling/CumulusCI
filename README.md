# CumulusCI

If you are already familiar with [Github Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) and just want to get up and running using this process in the Salesforce platform, follow these steps:

1. Copy the files from the template directory into your own project
2. Fill in the properties
3. In your package.xml, add the "fullName" element as a child of "Package", like this:

    ```   
    <fullName>YourPackageName</fullName>
    ```

4. Set up your CI server (Jenkins, Codeship,â€¦)
5. Clone CumulusCI in your CI server
6. Set a CUMULUSCI_PATH environment variable in the CI server that points to your forked copy
7. Make a commit to a branch to test everything works!
