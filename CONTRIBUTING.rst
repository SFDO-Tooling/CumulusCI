You can contribute in many ways:

Types of Contributions
----------------------

Report Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~

Report bugs at https://github.com/SFDO-Tooling/CumulusCI/issues.

When reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

Fix Bugs
~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help wanted" is open to whomever wants to implement it.

Implement Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement" and "help wanted" is open to whomever wants to implement it.

Write Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CumulusCI could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official CumulusCI docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/SFDO-Tooling/CumulusCI/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)

Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up CumulusCI for local development.

1. Fork the CumulusCI repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork to your local workspace.
3. Create a fresh virtual environment using virtualenv and install development requirements::

    $ pip install --no-use-pep517 -r requirements_dev.txt

4. Install ``pre-commit`` hooks for ``black`` and ``flake8``::

    $ pre-commit install --install-hooks

5. After making changes, run the tests and make sure they all pass::

    $ pytest

6. Push your changes to GitHub and submit a pull request. The base branch should be a new feature branch that we create to receive the changes (contact us to create the branch). This allows us to test the changes using our build system before merging to master.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

* Documentation is updated to reflect all changes.
* New classes, functions, etc have docstrings.
* New code has comments.
* Code style and file structure is similar to the rest of the project.
* You have run the `black` code formatter.

Releasing CumulusCI
-------------------

It's easy to release a version of CumulusCI to GitHub and PyPI! First, create a new branch for your version::

    $ git checkout -b feature/newversion

After committing any updates to HISTORY.rst and the docs, bump the version::

    $ bump2version patch
    $ git push -u origin HEAD

Open a Pull Request on GitHub and request approval from another committer. Once your PR has been merged, you can create the release tag and then push the artifacts PyPI with twine::

    $ git checkout master
    $ git pull
    $ make tag release

You can then create a pull request to update the `Homebrew Tap`_::

    $ make release-homebrew

Finally, head to the Release object that was autocreated in the GitHub repository, paste in the changelog notes and hit publish. Tada! You've published a new version of CCI.

Configuring Your Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To release CCI, you'll need twine and bump2version, both of which are installed with the development requirements. You'll also need to configure your `pypirc`_ file with your PyPI credentials. The ``release-homebrew`` build step depends on the `jq`_ command line utility and is available via Homebrew or your package manager.
