Write Documentation

CumulusCI could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official CumulusCI docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/CumulusCI/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)

Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up CumulusCI for local development.

1. Fork the CumulusCI repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork to your local workspace.
3. Create a fresh virtual environment using virtualenv and install development requirements::

    $ pip install -r requirements_dev.txt

4. After making changes, run the tests and make sure they all pass::

    $ nosetests

5. Push your changes to GitHub and submit a pull request. The base branch should be a new feature branch that we create to receive the changes (contact us to create the branch). This allows us to test the changes using our build system before merging to master.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

* Documentation is updated to reflect all changes.
* New classes, functions, etc have docstrings.
* New code has comments.
* Code style and file structure is similar to the rest of the project.
