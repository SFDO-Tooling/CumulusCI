# cumulusci: The command line interface to CumulusCI

# Setting up your local environment
The cumulusci command is written in Python and is designed to run in a Python virtualenv.  If you don't know what that is, no problem.  Follow the steps below to set up a virtualenv so you can run the cumulusci command yourself.

## Check out CumulusCI

First, you'll need to clone a copy of CumulusCI.  Go to wherever you keep development workspaces on your computer.

    git clone git@github.com:SalesforceFoundation/CumulusCI
    cd CumulusCI
    export CUMULUSCI_PATH=`pwd`

## Installing virtualenv on OS X

The easiest way to get virtualenv on OS X is using Homebrew.  The instructions below assume you already have the brew command

    brew install python

Then, continue along...

## Installing virtualenv

If you don't have the virtualenv command available, you can install it with pip:

    pip install virtualenv

## Creating your virtualenv (venv)

The virtualenv command allows you to build isolate python virtual environments in subfolders which you can easily activate and deactivate from the command line.  This keeps your modules isolated from your system's python and is generally a good idea.  It's also really easy.

    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    which python
        PATH_TO_YOUR_VENV/bin/python
    which pip
        PATH_TO_YOUR_VENV/bin/pip
    
At this point, your virtualenv is activated.  Your shell PATH points to python and pip (Python's package installer) inside your virtualenv.  Anything you install is isolated there.

## Installing the cumulusci command and dependencies

To initialize the cumulusci command, you need to run the following once inside your virtualenv:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

When the installation completes, you should be able to run the cumulusci command

    cumulusci
        Usage: cumulusci [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
        
        Options:
        --help  Show this message and exit.

        unmanaged_deploy    Runs a full deployment of the code including...
        update_package_xml  Updates the src/package.xml file by parsing...

As long as your virtualenv is activated, you can go into any repository configured for CumulusCI and use the cumulusci command to perform actions against it.

## Exiting and re-entering your virtualenv

If you start a new terminal session, you will need to initialize your virtualenv.

    cd PATH/TO/CumulusCI
    source venv/bin/activate

To leave your virtualenv

    deactivate

If you want to always have the cumulusci command available, you can add the following lines to your .bash_profile (or similar)

    export CUMULUSCI_PATH=PATH/TO/CumulusCI
    source $CUMULUSCI_PATH/venv/bin/activate

# Environment Variables

Most commands in cumulusci require credentials to external systems.  All credentials in the cumulusci command are passed via environment variables to avoid them ever being stored insecurely in files.

## Salesforce Org Credentials

* SF_USERNAME
* SF_PASSWORD: Append security token to password if needed
* SF_SERVERURL: (optional) Override the default login url: https://login.salesforce.com

## Packaging Org OAuth Credentials

For more information on how to get these values, see https://cumulusci-oauth-tool.herokuapp.com

* OAUTH_CLIENT_ID
* OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET
* OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL
* REFRESH_TOKEN
* INSTANCE_URL

## Github

* GITHUB_ORG_NAME
* GITHUB_REPO_NAME
* GITHUB_USERNAME
* GITHUB_PASSWORD: Usage of an application token is recommended instead of passwords

## Custom Branch and Tag Naming

CumulusCI defaults to the branch and tag prefixes shown below.  If you're using these, you don't need to configure anything:

* Master Branch: master
* Beta Release Tag: beta/
* Production Release Tag: release/

You can override any of these values with the following environment variables:

* MASTER_BRANCH
* PREFIX_BETA
* PREFIX_RELEASE

## Salesforce

    $ cumulusci unmanaged_deploy --help
    Detected None build of branch None at commit None on None
    Usage: cumulusci unmanaged_deploy [OPTIONS]
    
      Runs a full deployment of the code including unused stale package
      metadata, setting up dependencies, deploying the code, and optionally
      running tests
    
    Options:
      --run-tests    If set, run tests as part of the deployment.  Defaults to not
                     running tests
      --full-delete  If set, delete all package metadata at the start of the build
                     instead of doing an incremental delete.  **WARNING**: This
                     deletes all package metadata, use with caution.  This option
                     can be necessary if you have reference issues during an
                     incremental delete deployment.
      --ee-org       If set, use the deployUnmanagedEE target which prepares the
                     code for loading into a production Enterprise Edition org.
                     Defaults to False.
      --deploy-only  If set, runs only the deployWithoutTest target.  Does not
                     clean the org, update dependencies, or run any tests.  This
                     option invalidates all other options
      --help         Show this message and exit.

    $ cumulusci managed_deploy --help
    Detected None build of branch None at commit None on None
    Usage: cumulusci managed_deploy [OPTIONS] COMMIT PACKAGE_VERSION
    
      Installs a managed package version and optionally runs the tests from the
      installed managed package
    
    Options:
      --run-tests  If True, run tests as part of the deployment.  Defaults to
                   False
      --help       Show this message and exit.

    $ cumulusci run_tests --help
    Detected None build of branch None at commit None on None
    Usage: cumulusci run_tests [OPTIONS]
    
      Run Apex tests in the target org via the Tooling API and report results.
      Defaults to running all unmanaged test classes ending in _TEST.
    
    Options:
      --test-match TEXT    A SOQL like format value to match against the test
                           name.  Defaults to %_TEST.  You can use commas to
                           separate multiple values like
                           %_SMOKE_TESTS,%_LOAD_TESTS
      --test-exclude TEXT  Similar to --test-match, but adds exclusions to the
                           test name matching.  Defaults to no value.  You can use
                           commas to separate multiple values
      --namespace TEXT     If set, only search for tests inside the specified
                           namespace.  By default, all unmanaged tests are
                           searched
      --debug-logdir TEXT  A directory to store debug logs from each test class.
                           If specified, a TraceFlag is created which captures
                           debug logs.  When all tests have completed, the debug
                           logs are downloaded to the specified directory.  They
                           are then parsed to capture detail information on the
                           test.  See --json-output for more details
      --json-output TEXT   If set, outputs test results data in json format to the
                           specified file.  This option is most useful with the
                           --debug-logs option.  The resulting json file contains
                           detailed information on the code execution structure of
                           each test method including cumulative limits usage both
                           inside and outside the startTest/stopTest context
      --help               Show this message and exit.

                           package version
      --selenium-url TEXT  If provided, uses a Selenium Server at the specified
                           url.  Example: http://127.0.0.1:4444/wd/hub
