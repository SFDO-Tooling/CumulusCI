2.0.2 (2018-06-06)
------------------
* Bugfix: Update InstallPackageZipBuilder to use a recent api version to unblock installs.

2.0.1 (2018-06-06)
------------------
* Bugfix: Allow passing a connected app directly to OrgConfig.refresh_oauth_token.

2.0.0 (2018-06-01)
------------------

After over 19 months of development as alpha (40 version over 3 months) and beta (98 releases over 16 months) releases and over a year running production builds using CumulusCI, it's time to remove the "beta" label.

This marks the first production release of CumulusCI 2.x!

2.0.0-beta99 (2018-05-31)
-------------------------

* Ensure that github credentials are never shown in the log for github dependencies with unmanaged metadata

2.0.0-beta98 (2018-05-31)
-------------------------
**WARNING: This release introduces breaking changes to the syntax for flow definitions and to the default flows.  If you customized any of the default flows in your project or have defined custom flows, you will need to modify your cumulusci.yml file to work with this release.**

Changes default flows shipped with CumulusCI to a new syntax and structure taking advantage of the ability for flows to call other flows.  This allows flows to be modularized in ways that weren't possible when the original set of flows was designed.

* The **tasks:** section in cumulusci.yml for a flow is now renamed to **steps:**  A **FlowConfigError** will be raised if an old style flow definition is detected.  All existing flow customizations and custom flows need to be changed in the **cumulusci.yml** to avoid raising an exception.
* All default flows have been restructured.  Existing customizations of default flows likely need to be changed to adapt to the new structure.  In most cases, you will want to move your customizations to some of the new **config_*** or **deploy_*** instead of the main flows.
* **ci_beta_install** has been removed and replaced with **install_beta** and **uninstall_managed**  **install_beta** does not attempt to uninstall an existing version of the package.  If you need to uninstall the package first, use the **uninstall_managed** flow before running **install_beta**
* Added new **qa_org** flow to allow different configurations for dev vs QA orgs
* New modularized flows structure allows for easier and more reusable customization:

    * **dependencies** Runs the pre-package deployment dependency tasks **update_dependencies** and **deploy_pre**  This flow is called by almost all the main flows.
    * **config_*** flows provide a place to customize the package configuration for different environments.  These flows are called by the main flows after the package metadata is deployed or a managed version is installed.  Customizations to the config flows automatically apply to the main flows.

        * **config_apextest** Configure org for running apex tests
        * **config_dev** Configure org for dev use
        * **config_managed** Configure org with a managed package version installed
        * **config_packaging** Configure the packaging org
        * **config_qa** Configure org for QA use

    * **deploy_*** flows provide a place to customize how metadata deployments are done.  The deploy flows do more than just a simple deployment such as unscheduling scheduled jobs, rebuilding the package.xml, and incrementally deleting any stale metadata in the package from the org.

        * **deploy_unmanaged** Used to do a standard deployment of the unmanaged metadata
        * **deploy_packaging** Used to deploy to packaging.  Wraps the **create_managed_src** task around the deploy to inject metadata that can only be deployed to the packaging org
        * **deploy_unmanaged_ee** Used to deploy unmanaged metadata to an Enterprise Edition org using the **create_unmanaged_ee_src** task

* **github** dependencies can now point to a private Github repository.  All zip downloads from Github will pass the password (should be a personal access token) from the **github** service configured in the CumulusCI keychain.
* **GithubRelease**, **PushUpgradeRequest**, and **PackageUploadRequest** now track the release data as return values

2.0.0-beta80 (2018-01-08)
-------------------------

* The deploy tasks now automatically clean all meta.xml files in the deployed metadata of any namespace references by removing the <packageVersions> element and children.  This allows CumulusCI to fully manage the dependencies and avoids the need for new commits to change referenced versions in meta.xml files.
    * The default functionality can be disabled with the by setting `clean_meta_xml` to False
* Github dependencies can now point to a specific tag in the repository.  The tag is used to determine the version to install for the dependency if the repository has a namespace configured and will be used to determine which unpackaged metadata to deploy.

-------------------------

* Fixes #540: Using a custom `prefix_beta` fails if releases with the same version but different prefix already exist in the repository.  Changed to use `tag_name` instead of `name` to check if the release already exists in Github.

-------------------------

Resolving a few issues from beta77:

* A bug in BaseKeychain.create_scratch_org was causing the creation of ScratchOrgConfig's with a days value of None.  This caused issues with subsequent calls against the org.

* `cci org remove` will now attempt to first delete a scratch org if one was already created
* `cci org scratch` will prevent you from overwritting a scratch config that has already created a scratch org (which would create an orphaned scratch org) and direct you to use `cci org remove` instead.
* `cci org list` now shows the duration days, elapsed days, and if an org is expired.
* `cci org info` now shows the expiration date for scratch orgs
* All `cci` commands that update an org config will now attept to automatically recreate an expired scratch org
* New namespace inject token strings are supported for injecting namespaces into Lightning Component references:

  * **%%%NAMESPACE_OR_C%%%***: Replaced with either 'your_namespace' (unmanaged = False) or 'c' (unmanaged = True)
  * **%%%NAMESPACED_ORG_OR_C%%%***: Replaced with either 'your_namespace' (namespaced_org = True) or 'c' (namespaced_org = False)

2.0.0-beta65 (2017-10-18)
-------------------------

Breaking Changes
================

* If you created custom tasks off of `DeployNamespaced` or `DeployNamespacedBundles`, you will need to switch to using `Deploy` and `DeployBundles`.  The recommended configuration for such custom tasks is represented below.  In flows that need to inject the actual namespace prefix, override the `unmanaged` option .. ::

    custom_deploy_task:
        class_path: cumulusci.tasks.salesforce.Deploy
        options:
            path: your/custom/metadata
            namespace_inject: $project_config.project__package__namespace
            unmanaged: False

Enhancements
============

* The `cci` CLI will now check for new versions and print output at the top of the log if a new version is available
* The `cci` keychain now automatically creates orgs for all named scratch org configs in the project.  The orgs are created with the same name as the config.  Out of the box, CumulusCI comes with 4 org configs: `dev`, `feature`, `beta`, and `release`.  You can add additional org configs per project using the `orgs` -> `scratch` section of the project's `cumulusci.yml`.  With this change, `cci org list` will always show at least 4 orgs for any project.  If an org already exists in the keychain, it is not touched and no scratch org config is auto-created for that config.  The goal is to eliminate the need to call `cci org scratch` in most cases and make it easier for new users to get up and running with scratch orgs and CumulusCI.
* `cci org remove <org_name>` is now available to remove orgs from the keychain
* Scratch orgs created by CumulusCI are now aliased using the naming format `ProjectName__org_name` so you can easily run sfdx commands against scratch orgs created by CumulusCI
* `cci org list` now shows more information including `scratch`, `config_name`, and `username`.  NOTE: config_name will only be populated for newly created scratch configs.  You can use `cci org scratch` to recreate the config in the keychain.
* The new flow `dev_org_namespaced` provides a base flow for deploying unmanaged metadata into a namespaced org such as a namespaced scratch org
* All tasks which previously supported `namespace_inject` now support a new option, `namespaced_org`.  This option is designed to handle use cases of namespaced orgs such as a namespaced scratch org.  In namespaced orgs, all unmanaged metadata gets the namespace prefix even if it is not included in the package.  You can now use the `namespaced_org` option along with the file content token `%%%NAMESPACED_ORG%%%` and the file name token `___NAMESPACED_ORG___` to inject the namespace when deploying to a namespaced org.  `namespaced_org` defaults to False to be backwards compatible with previous functionality.
* New task `push_list` supports easily pushing a list of OrgIds via the Push API from the CLI: `cci task run push_list -o file <file_path> -o version 1.2 --org packaging`


2.0.0-beta64 (2017-09-29)
-------------------------

* Show proper exit status for failed tests in heroku_ci.sh
* Handle BrowserTestFailure in CLI
* Fix issue that prevented auto-merging master to parent branch

2.0.0-beta63 (2017-09-26)
-------------------------

* Documentation has been updated!
* CumulusCI now supports auto detection of repository information from CI environments.  This release includes an implementation for Heroku CI

2.0.0-beta62 (2017-09-19)
-------------------------

* cci now supports both namespaced and non-namespaced scratch org configurations in the same project.  The default behavior changes slightly with this release.  Before, if the `sfdx-project.json` had a namespace configured, all scratch orgs created via `cci org scratch` would get the namespace.  With the new functionality, all orgs would by default not have the namespace.  You can configure individual org configs in your project's `cumulusci.yml` file by setting `namespace: True` under `orgs -> scratch -> <org_name>`

2.0.0-beta61 (2017-09-12)
-------------------------

* Fix bug that was causing a forced token refresh with `sfdx force:org:open` at the start of a flow or task run against a freshly created scratch org.
* Add support for Big Objects with `__b` suffix in `update_package_xml` and `update_package_xml_managed`
* Fix bug that caused release notes sections to not render if only h2 content found

2.0.0-beta60 (2017-09-06)
-------------------------

* Add support for Platform Events with `__e` suffix in `update_package_xml` and `update_package_xml_managed`

2.0.0-beta59 (2017-09-06)
-------------------------

* `YamlProjectConfig` can now accept an `additional_yaml` keyword argument on initialization.  This allows a 5th level of layering to the `cumulusci.yml` config.  This change is not wired up to the CLI yet but is available for application built on top of cumulusci to use.
* `cumulusci.core.flow` and `cumulusci.core.keychain` now have 100% test coverage

2.0.0-beta58 (2017-08-29)
-------------------------

* Fix import error in `github_release_notes` task introduced in beta57

2.0.0-beta57 (2017-08-28)
-------------------------

* Task options can now dynamically reference attributes from the project_config using the syntax `$project_config.attr_name`.  For example, `$project_config.repo_branch` will resolve to the current branch when the task options are initialized.
* New task `github_parent_to_children` uses new functionality in `MergeBranch` to support merging from a parent feature branch (ex. `feature/parent`) into all child branches (ex. `feature/parent__child`).
* `github_master_to_feature` task will now skip child branches if their corresponding parent branch exists
* `ci_feature` flow now runs `github_parent_to_children` at the end of the flow
* Github task classes were restructured but the `class_path` used in `cumulusci.yml` remains the same
* New test coverage for github tasks


2.0.0-beta56 (2017-08-07)

  * NOTE: CumulusCI will no longer work with the sfdx pilot release after this version!
  * Replaced call to `force:org:describe` with `force:org:display`
  * Changed json response parsing to match beta format

* New SFDX wrapper tasks

  * `SFDXBaseTask`: Use for tasks that don't need org access

  * `SFDXJsonTask`: Use for building tasks that interact with sfdx via json responses
  * `SFDXJsonPollingTask`: Use for building tasks that wrap sfdx json responses including polling for task completion
  * `SFDXDeploy`: An example of using `SFDXJsonPollingTask` to wrap `force:mdapi:deploy`

* Fixed infinite loop if setting scratch org password fails

------------------------

* The new `BaseSalesforceApiTask` class replaces `BaseSalesforceApiTask`, `BaseSalesforceBulkApiTask`, and `BaseSalesforceToolingApiTask` by combining them into a single task class with access to all 3 API's via `self.sf`, `self.tooling`, and `self.bulk` from inside a task instance.
* Added integration with sentry.io

  * Use `cci service connect sentry` to enable the sentry service
  * All task execution exceptions will be logged as error events in sentry
  * `cci task run` and `cci flow run` will now show you the url to the sentry event if one was registered and prompt to open in a browser.
  * `cci task run` and `cci flow run` now accept the `--no-prompt` option flag for running in non-interactive mode with the sentry service configured.  Use this if you want to log build errors in sentry but not have builds fail due to a hanging prompt.

* If a scratch org password has expired, it is now regenerated when calling `cci org info`
* New task `unschedule_apex` was added to unschedule background jobs and added to the start of the `dev_org` flow
* `update_meta_xml` task now uses the project's dependencies as the namespace/version to update in the meta.xml files
* The bulkdata mapping now properly supports Record Types
* Fixed a bug with BulkDataQuery where local references weren't getting properly set
* New CumulusCI Branch & Release Overview diagram presention is available at http://developer.salesforce.org/CumulusCI/diagram/process_overview.html  Use left/right arrow buttons on your keyboard to navigate through the presentation.

* New task class BulkDataQuery reverses the BulkDataLoad and uses the mapping to build SOQL queries to capture the data in the mapping from the target org.  The data is written to a database that can then be used by BulkDataLoad to load into a different org.
* The Delete util task now uses the glob library so it can support paths with wildcards like src/*
* New tasks `meta_xml_api` and `meta_xml_dependencies` handle updating `*-meta.xml` files with api versions or underlying package versions.

------------------------

* `update_dependencies` now supports dynamically referencing other Github repositories configured with a cumulusci.yml file.  The referenced repository's cumulusci.yml is parsed and the dependencies are included.

            tasks:
                1:
                    task: deploy
