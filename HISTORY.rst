3.19.0 (2020-09-17)
-------------------

Changes:

- Tasks and automation:

  - CumulusCI now supports using the REST Collections API in data load, extract, and delete operations. By default, CumulusCI will select an API for you based on data volume (<2000 records uses the REST API, >=2000 uses Bulk); a desired API can be configured via the mapping file.
  - Removed the namespace_tokenize option from tasks that deploy metadata, and removed the namespace_inject option from tasks that retrieve metadata, because it's unclear when they would be useful.
  - The task create_permission_set allows for creating and assigning a Permission Set that enables specific User Permissions. (Note: other types of permissions are not yet supported).
  - The task create_bulk_data_permission_set creates a Permission Set with the Hard Delete and Set Audit Fields permissions for use with data load operations. The org permission to allow Set Audit Fields must be turned on.
  - CumulusCI's load_dataset and extract_dataset tasks now support relative dates. To take advantage of relative dates, include the anchor_date key (with a date in YYYY-MM-DD format) in each mapping step you wish to relativize. On extract, dates will be modified to be the same interval from the anchor date as they are from the current date; on load, dates will be modified to be the same interval from today's date as they are from their anchor. Both date and date-time fields are supported.

- Other:

  - The oid_as_pk key is no longer supported in bulk data mappings. (This key was already deprecated). Select object Id mode by including the Id field in mappings.

Issues closed:

  - Fixed an issue (#2001) that caused CumulusCI to extract invalid data sets when using after: steps with autoincrement primary keys.
  - Fixed an issue where the retrieve_changes task did not actually retrieve folders.
  - Fixed a bug in the metadeploy_publish task where labels starting with "Install " were not extracted for localization.
  - Fixed a bug that prevented using JWT auth with sandboxes if the sandbox's instance_url did not include an instance name.
  - Fixed a bug where ``cci project init`` generated an invalid mapping for bulk data tasks.

3.18.0 (2020-09-03)
-------------------

Changes:

-  Tasks and automation:

   -  CumulusCI now tries 10 times (instead of 5) to install managed package versions, which helps ameliorate timeouts when new versions are released.
   -  We added support for CSV files to the ``push_list`` task.
   -  We added a ``ref`` option to ``github_copy_subtree`` to allow publishing a git reference (commit hash, branch, or tag).
   -  Changed the ``disable_tdtm_trigger_handlers`` (SetTDTMHandlerStatus) task so that trigger handler state is remembered in the cache directory instead of ``REPO_ROOT``.

-  User experience:

   -  The ``cci error info`` command now defaults to showing the entire traceback when it is more than 30 lines.

-  Robot Framework:

   -  The following robot keywords have been updated to work with Winter '21:

      -  ``Load related list``
      -  ``Click related list button``
      -  ``Click related item link``
      -  ``Click related item popup link``
      -  ``Go to object home``
      -  ``Go to object list``
      -  ``Go to record home``
      -  ``Populate lookup field``

   -  The keyword ``Load related list`` has been rewritten to be slightly more efficient. It also has a new parameter ``tries`` which can be used if the target is more than 1000 pixels below the bottom of the window.

Issues Closed:

-  Fixed a bug where ``cci error gist`` could throw a UnicodeDecodeError on Windows
   (fixes #1977)
-  Fixed a bug where ``cci org list`` could throw a TypeError when run
   outside a project directory (fixes #1998)
-  The ``metadeploy_publish`` task can now update translations for
   language codes with more than 2 letters.
-  Fixed a bug where the ``extract_dataset`` task could fail with a
   UnicodeEnodeError on Windows.
-  ``update_dependencies`` deduplicates its package install list, making it possible to handle situations where the same beta package is reached by two dependency paths.

3.17.0 (2020-08-20)
-------------------

Changes:

- Tasks and automation:

  - We added the  ``upload_user_profile_photo`` and ``upload_default_user_profile_photo`` tasks, which allow for setting Users' profile photos from images stored in the repository. (Thanks to @spelak-salesforce).
  - We added the property ``is_person_accounts_enabled`` to the ``org_config`` object, which is available in ``when`` clauses. (Thanks to @spelak-salesforce).

- Policies and inclusive language:

  - We added information about Salesforce's Open Source Community Code of Conduct and Security policies.
  - We updated documentation to more consistently refer to the "main" branch, reflecting CumulusCI's support for per-project specification of main branches other than ``master``.

- User experience:

  - We modified how we handle situations where the default org is not valid for better user experience.
  - We catch a common mistake in entering command-line options (``-org`` instead of ``--org``, as well as incorrectly-formatted flow options) and show a clearer error.
  - We now capture and display the ``InstanceName`` of orgs in ``cci org list``'s output.

- Robot Framework:

  - We now cleanly fall back to the latest available API version for Robot locators if the newest API version does not have an available locator file. This change helps support Robot testing on the latest prerelease editions of Salesforce.
  - We included some updates to locators for API version 50.0.

- Other:

  - We added a new environment variable, ``SFDX_SIGNUP_INSTANCE``, and an ``instance`` key in org definitions, to specify a preferred instance routing. NOTE: this functionality requires Dev Hub permissions that are not Generally Available.

Issues closed:

- Fixed a bug which prevented package install links from getting added to release notes.
- Fixed a bug (#1914) which caused errors when customizing some Flow steps with decimal step numbers.
- Fixed a bug making it difficult to troubleshoot issues with Snowfakery and CumulusCI on Windows.
- Fixed a bug in ``update_admin_profile`` that resulted in errors when attempting to manage Record Types across multiple objects.


3.16.0 (2020-08-06)
-------------------

Changes:

- Project initialization:

  - When starting a new CumulusCI project, the ``cci project init`` command now uses the current git branch as the project's default branch.

  - API version 49.0 is now set as the default for new projects.

- Bulk data tasks:

  - Added a task called ``delete_data`` for deleting all data from specified objects. This was previously available but required manually adding it to ``cumulusci.yml``

  - The ``load_dataset``, ``extract_dataset``, and ``delete_data`` tasks now support automatic namespace injection. When object and field names are specified without namespaces, but the target org only has them with a namespace prefix attached, CumulusCI automatically adds the namespace prefix. This makes it easier for projects to use a single mapping file for unmanaged orgs, namespaced scratch org, and managed orgs.

  This behavior is on by default, but may be disabled by setting the ``inject_namespaces`` option to False. This feature is believed to be backwards-compatible; however, projects that subclass built-in data loading classes, or which use data loading tasks in very unusual ways, might be impacted.

  - The ``load_dataset`` and ``extract_dataset`` tasks have a new option, ``drop_missing_schema``. When enabled, this option causes CumulusCI to silently ignore elements in a dataset or mapping that are not present in the target org. This option is useful when building datasets that support additional, optional managed packages or features, which may or may not be installed.

  - The ``extract_dataset`` and ``load_dataset`` tasks now support Person Accounts. These will be handled automatically as long as both Account and Contact are in the mapping file. Additional fields should be added to the Account mapping rather than Contact. Thanks @spelak-salesforce

  - The ``generate_dataset_mapping`` task generates mappings in line with the latest revisions of load/extract functionality: fields are specified as a list, the ``table`` key is omitted, and namespaces are stripped.

  - The ``generate_dataset_mapping`` has improved logic for resolving reference cycles between objects. If one of the lookup fields is nillable, the object with that field will be listed first in the generated mapping file.

  - The ``generate_and_load_from_yaml`` task has a new option, ``working_directory``, which can be used to keep temporary files for debugging. The ``debug_dir`` option has been removed.

- Robot Framework:

  - The ``robot`` task has a new option, ``processes``. If the value is > 1, tests will be run in parallel in the given number of processes, using `pabot <https://pabot.org/>`_. Note: It's still up to the test author to make sure the tests won't conflict with each other when running in parallel. This feature is considered experimental.

  - Added an ``ObjectManager`` page object for interacting with the Object Manager in Setup. Thanks to @rjanjanam

  - `RequestsLibrary <https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-requests>`_ is now included as a way to test REST APIs from Robot Framework.

- Metadata ETL:

  - Added a new task, ``set_field_help_text``, which can be used to update Help Text values on existing fields.

  - Added a new task, ``update_metadata_first_child_text``, which can be used to update a single value in existing metadata. Thanks @spelak-salesforce

  - Added a new task, ``assign_compact_layout``, which can update a compact layout assignment in existing object metadata. Thanks @spelak-salesforce

- Added a new task, ``github_copy_subtree``, to allow publishing selected files or folders to another repository after a release. This allows publishing a subset of your project's code from a private repository to a public one, for example. 

- The ``create_community`` task has a new option, ``skip_existing``. When True, the task will not error if a community with the specified name already exists.

- The ``release_beta`` and ``release_production`` flows now generate a section in the release notes on GitHub including package install links.

- Task options can now use ``$project_config`` substitutions in any position, not just at the start of the value.

Issues closed:

- Fixed a bug where changes to global orgs would be saved as project-specific orgs.

- Fixed a bug where ``cumulusci.yml`` could fail to parse if certain options were specified in ``cci project init`` (#1780)

- The ``install_managed`` task now recognizes an additional error message that indicates a package version has not yet finished propagating, and performs retries appropriately.

- Fixed a bug in the logic to prevent installing beta packages in non-scratch orgs.

- Fixed a bug where the ``list_changes``, ``retrieve_changes``, and ``snapshot_changes`` tasks could error while trying to reset sfdx source tracking.

- Fixed a bug where the ``push_failure_report`` task could be missing some failed orgs if there were more than 200 errors.

- Fixed a bug where the ``github_release_notes`` task could list a change note under a wrong subheading from a different section.

- Fixed freezing of command tasks for MetaDeploy.

Internal changes (these should not affect you unless you're interacting with CumulusCI at the Python level):

  - Standardized naming of different levels of configuration:

    - ``BaseGlobalConfig`` is now ``UniversalConfig``.

    - ``BaseGlobalConfig.config_global_local_path`` is now ``UniversalConfig.config_global_path``

    - ``BaseGlobalConfig.config_global_path`` is  now ``UniversalConfig.config_universal_path``

    - ``BaseProjectConfig.global_config_obj`` is now ``universal_config_obj``

    - ``BaseProjectConfig.config_global`` is now ``config_universal``

    - ``BaseProjectConfig.config_global_local`` is now ``config_global``

    - ``EncryptedFileProjectKeychain.config_local_dir`` is now ``global_config_dir``

    - ``BaseCumulusCI.global_config_class`` is now ``universal_config_class``

    - ``BaseCumulusCI.global_config`` is now ``universal_config``

  - Added ``UniversalConfig.cumulusci_config_dir`` as a central way to get the path for storing configuration.  ``UniversalConfig.config_local_dir`` was removed.

  - OrgConfigs now keep track of which keychain they were loaded from, and have a new `save` method which is the preferred API for persisting updates to the config.

3.15.0 (2020-07-09)
-------------------

Changes:

* The ``run_tests`` task now defaults to only logging tests that failed. Set the ``verbose`` option to True to see all results including tests that passed.

* The ``update_dependencies`` task now supports an ``ignore_dependencies`` option, which prevents CumulusCI from processing a specific dependency (whether direct or transitive). This feature may be useful in installers for packages that extend other packages if the installer is not meant to include the base package.

* Improvements to the mapping file for the ``extract_dataset`` and ``load_dataset`` tasks:

  * Fields can now be specified as a simple list of Salesforce API names, instead of a mapping. CumulusCI will infer the database column names.
  * Mappings may omit the ``table`` key and CumulusCI will use the object name.
  * The tasks will check and show an error if mappings do not use a consistent object Id mode.
  * Mappings can now include junction objects with no additional fields.

* The ``generate_dataset_mapping`` task now has an ``include`` option to specify additional objects to include in the mapping if they aren't found by the default heuristics.

* Added additional tasks intended for use as preflight checks for MetaDeploy install plans:

  * ``check_sobjects_enabled`` returns a set of available SObject names.
  * ``check_org_wide_defaults`` returns a boolean indicating whether Organization-Wide Defaults match the specified values.

* The ``update_package_xml`` task now supports the MessageChannel metadata type.

* Adjusted the default rules for the ``robot_lint`` task.

* CumulusCI can be configured to always show Python stack traces in the case of an error by setting the ``show_stacktraces`` option to True in the ``cli`` section of ``~/.cumulusci/cumulusci.yml``.

* The prompt provided by ``cci org shell`` now has access to the Tooling API through the keyword ``tooling``.

* When using the JWT OAuth2 flow, CumulusCI can be configured to use alternate Salesforce login URLs by setting the SF_PROD_LOGIN_URL and SF_SANDBOX_LOGIN_URL environment variables.

Issues closed:

* Fixed a UnicodeDecodeError that could happen while using the ``extract_dataset`` task on Windows. (#1838)

* Fixed support for the CustomHelpMenuSection metadata type in the ``update_package_xml`` task. (#1832)

* Deleting a scratch org now clears its domain from showing in `cci org list`.

* If you try to use ``cci org connect`` with a login URL containing ``lightning.force.com``, CumulusCI will explain that you should use the ``.my.salesforce.com`` domain instead.

* Fixed an issue with deriving the Lightning domain from the instance URL for some orgs.

3.14.0 (2020-06-18)
-------------------

Changes:

* Added a generic ``dx`` task which makes it easy to run Salesforce CLI commands against orgs in CumulusCI's keychain. Use the ``command`` option to specify the sfdx command.

* Tasks which do namespace injection now support the ``%%%NAMESPACE_DOT%%%`` injection token, which can be used to support references to packaged Apex classes and Record Types. The token is replaced with ``ns.`` rather than ``ns__`` (for namespace ``ns``).

* Updated to Robot Framework 3.2.1. Robot Framework has a new parser with a few backwards incompatible changes. For details see the `release notes <https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/blob/master/doc/releasenotes/rf-3.2.rst>`_.

* The ``run_tests`` task now gracefully handles the ``required_org_code_coverage_percent`` option as a string or an integer.

* CumulusCI now logs a success message when a flow finishes running.

Issues closed:

* Fixed a regression introduced in CumulusCI 3.13.0 where connections to a scratch org could fail with a ReadTimeout or other connection error if more than 10 minutes elapsed since a prior task that interacted with the org. This is similar to the fix from 3.13.2, but for scratch orgs.

* Show a clearer error message if dependencies are configured in an unrecognized format.

3.13.2 (2020-06-10)
-------------------

Issues closed:

* Fixed a regression introduced in CumulusCI 3.13.0 where connections to Salesforce could fail
  with a ReadTimeout or other connection error if more than 10 minutes elapsed since a prior task
  that interacted with the org.

3.13.1 (2020-06-09)
-------------------

Issues closed:

* Fixed a bug with "after:" steps in the `load_dataset` task.
* Fixed a bug with record types in the `extract_dataset` task.

3.13.0 (2020-06-04)
-------------------

Changes:

* A new Metadata ETL task, ``add_picklist_entries``, safely adds picklist values to an existing custom field.

* Added the ``cci org prune`` command to automatically remove all expired scratch orgs from the CumulusCI keychain.

* Improvements to the ``cci org shell`` command:

  * Better inline help
  * New ``query`` and ``describe`` functions

* Scratch org creation will now wait up to 120 minutes for the org to be created
  to avoid timeouts with more complex org shapes.

* The ``generate_data_dictionary`` task now has more features for complex projects.
  By default, the task will walk through all project dependencies and include them
  in the generated data dictionaries. Other non-dependency projects can be included
  with the ``additional_dependencies`` option. The output format has been extensively improved.

* The ``run_tests`` task supports a new option, ``required_org_code_coverage_percent``.
  If set, the task will fail if aggregate code coverage in the org is less than the configured value.
  Code coverage verification is available only in unmanaged builds.

* The ``install_managed`` and ``update_dependencies`` tasks now accept a ``security_type`` option
  to specify whether the package should be installed for all users or for admins only.

* ``when`` expressions can now use the ``has_minimum_package_version`` method
  to check if a package is installed with a sufficient version. For example:
  ``when: org_config.has_minimum_package_version("namespace", "1.0")``

* Robot Framework:

  * Added a new keyword in the modal page objects, ``Select dropdown value``.
    This keyword will be available whenever you use the ``Wait for modal`` keyword
    to pull in a modal page object.

Issues closed:

  * Limited the variables available in global scope for the ``cci shell`` command.
  * Tasks based on ``BaseSalesforceApiTask`` which use the Bulk API now default
    to using the project's API version rather than 40.0.
  * Bulk data tasks:

    * The ``extract_dataset`` task no longer converts to snake_case when picking a name for lookup columns.
    * Improved error message when trying to use the ``load_dataset`` command with an incorrect record type.
    * Fixed a bug with the ``generate_mapping_file`` option.


3.12.2 (2020-05-07)
-------------------

Changes:

* Added a task, ``set_duplicate_rule_status``, which allows selective activation and
  deactivation of Duplicate Rules.

* The ``create_community`` task now retries multiple times if there's an error.

* The ``generate_data_dictionary`` task now supports multi-select picklist fields
  and will indicate the related object for lookup fields.

* The ``update_package_xml`` task now supports the ``NavigationMenu`` metadata type.

Issues closed:

* In the Salesforce library for Robot Framework,
  fixed locators for the actions ribbon and app launcher button in Summer '20.

* Fixed the ``load_dataset`` task so that steps which don't explicitly specify a ``bulk_mode``
  will inherit the option specified at the task level.

* Fixed error handling if an exception occurs within one of the `cci error` commands.

* Fixed error handling if the Metadata API returns a response that is marked as done
  but also contains an ``errorMessage``.

3.12.1 (2020-04-27)
-------------------

Fixed a problem building the Homebrew formula for installing CumulusCI 3.12.0.

3.12.0 (2020-04-27)
-------------------

Changes:

* We've removed the prompt that users see when trying to use a scratch org that has expired,
  and now automatically recreate the scratch org.

* The ``load_dataset`` task now automatically avoids creating Bulk API batches larger than the
  10 million character limit.

* Robot Framework:

  * When opening an org in the browser, the Salesforce library now attempts to detect if the org
    was created using the Classic UI and automatically switch to Lightning Experience.

  * The Salesforce library now has preliminary support for Summer '20 preview orgs.

* CumulusCI now directs ``simple-salesforce`` to return results as normal Python dicts
  instead of OrderedDicts.  This should have minimal impact since normal dicts are ordered
  in the versions of Python that CumulusCI supports, but we mention it for the sake of completeness.

Issues closed:

* Fixed an issue where non-ASCII output caused an error when trying to write to the CumulusCI log
  in Windows. (#1619)

3.11.0 (2020-04-17)
-------------------

Changes:

* CumulusCI now includes `Snowfakery <https://pypi.org/project/snowfakery/>`_,
  a tool for generating fake data. It can be used to generate and load data into an org
  via the new ``generate_and_load_from_yaml`` task.

* Added two new preflight check tasks for use in MetaDeploy:
  ``get_available_licenses`` and ``get_available_permission_set_licenses``.
  These tasks make available lists of the License Definition Keys for the org's licenses or PSLs.

* The ``get_installed_packages`` task now logs its result.

* Robot Framework: Added two new keywords (``Get Fake Data`` and ``Set Faker Locale``)
  and a global robot variable (``${faker}``) which can be used to generate fake data
  using the `Faker <https://pypi.org/project/Faker/>`_ library.

Issues closed:

* Fixed an error when loading a dependency whose ``cumulusci.yml`` contains non-breaking spaces.

* Fixed a PermissionError when running multiple concurrent CumulusCI commands in Windows. (#1477)

* Show a more helpful error message if a keychain entry can't be loaded
  due to a change in the encryption key.

* Fixed the ``org_settings`` task to use the API version of the org rather than the API version of the package.

* In the Salesforce Robot Framework library, the ``Open App Launcher`` keyword now tries to detect
  and recover from an occasional situation where the app launcher fails to load.


3.10.0 (2020-04-02)
-------------------

Changes:

* Added ``custom_settings_value_wait`` task to wait for a custom setting to have a particular value.

* The ``metadeploy_publish`` task now has a ``labels_path`` option which specifies a folder to store translations. After publishing a plan, labels_en.json will be updated with the untranslated labels from the plan. Before publishing a plan, labels from other languages will be published to MetaDeploy.

Issues closed:

* Fixed an issue where running subprocesses could hang if too much output was buffered.


3.9.1 (2020-03-25)
------------------

Issues closed:

* The ``batch_apex_wait`` task will now detect aborted and failed jobs instead of waiting indefinitely.

* Fixed reporting of errors from Robot Framework when it exits with a return code > 250.

* Fixed an ImportError that could happen when importing the new metadata ETL tasks.

* Fixed bugs in how the ``set_organization_wide_defaults`` and ``update_admin_profile`` tasks operated in namespaced scratch orgs.

* Show a more helpful error message if CumulusCI can't find a project's repository or release on GitHub. (#1281)

* Fixed the message shown for skipped steps in ``cci flow info``.

* Fixed a regression which accidentally removed support for the ``bulk_mode`` option in bulk data mappings.


3.9.0 (2020-03-16)
------------------

Critical changes:

* The ``update_admin_profile`` task can now add field-level permissions for all packaged objects.
  This behavior is the default for projects with ``minimum_cumulusci_version`` >= 3.9.0 that are
  not using the ``package_xml`` option. Other projects can opt into it using the
  ``include_packaged_objects`` option.

  The Python class used for this task has been renamed to ``ProfileGrantAllAccess`` and refactored
  to use the Metadata ETL framework. This is a breaking change for custom tasks that subclassed
  ``UpdateAdminProfile`` or ``UpdateProfile``.

* Refactored how CumulusCI uses the Bulk API to load, extract, and delete data sets.
  These changes should have no functional impact, but projects that subclass
  CumulusCI's bulk data tasks should carefully review the changes.

Changes:

* New projects created using ``cci project init`` will now get set up with scratch org settings to:

  * Use the Enhanced Profile Editor
  * Allow logging in as another user
  * _not_ force relogin after Login-As

* If ``cumulusci.yml`` contains non-breaking spaces in indentation,
  they will be automatically converted to normal spaces.

* Bulk data tasks:

  * Added improved validation that mapping files are in the expected format.

  * When using the ``ignore_row_errors`` option, warnings will be suppressed after the 10th row with errors.

Issues closed:

* The ``github_release`` task now validates the ``commit`` option to make sure it is in the right format.

* If there is an error from ``sfdx`` while using the ``retrieve_changes`` task, it will now be logged.


3.8.0 (2020-02-28)
------------------

Changes:

* The ``batch_apex_wait`` task can now wait for chained batch jobs,
  i.e. when one job starts another job of the same class.

* The metadata ETL tasks that were added in cumulusci 3.7.0 have been refactored
  to use a new library, ``cumulusci.utils.xml.metadata_tree``, which streamlines
  building Salesforce Metadata XML in Python. If you got an early start writing
  custom tasks using the metadata ETL task framework, you may need to adjust them
  to work with this library instead of lxml.

Issues closed:

* Adjusted the ``run_tests`` task to avoid an error due to not being able
  to access the symbol table for managed Apex classes in Spring '20.
  Due to this limitation, CumulusCI now will not attempt to retry class-level
  concurrency failures when running Apex unit tests in a managed package.
  Such failures will be logged but will not cause a build failure.

* Corrected a bug in storing preflight check results for MetaDeploy
  when multiple tasks have the same path.

3.7.0 (2020-02-20)
------------------

Changes:

* Added a framework for building tasks that extract, transform, and load metadata from a Salesforce org.
  The initial set of tasks include:

  * ``add_standard_value_set_entries`` to add entries to a StandardValueSet.
  * ``add_page_layout_related_lists`` to add Related Lists to a Page Layout.
  * ``add_permission_set_perms`` to add field permissions and Apex class accesses to a Permission Set.
  * ``set_organization_wide_defaults`` to set the Organization-Wide Defaults for one or more objects
    and wait for the operation to complete.

* Added a new task ``insert_record`` to insert a single sObject record via the REST API.

* The ``update_admin_profile`` task now accepts a ``profile_name`` option, which defaults to Admin.
  This allows the task to be used to update other Profiles.
  (The task class has been renamed to UpdateProfile, but can still be used with the old name.)

* Updated to use Metadata API version 48.0 as the default for new projects.

* Robot Framework: Improved documentation for the API keywords in the Salesforce keyword library.

Issues closed:

* Fixed the ``cci error info`` command. It was failing to load the log from the previous command.

* Fixed a bug where some error messages were not displayed correctly.

* Adjusted the Salesforce Robot Framework keyword library for better stability in Chrome 80.

* Fixed a bug where using SFDXOrgTask to run an sfdx command on a non-scratch org would break
  with "Must pass a username and/or OAuth options when creating an AuthInfo instance."

* Fixed a bug where an error while extracting the repository of a cross-project source
  could leave behind an incomplete copy of the codebase which would then be used by future commands.

3.6.0 (2020-02-06)
------------------

Changes:

* `cci task info` now has Command Syntax section and improved formatting of option information.

* CumulusCI now displays a more helpful error message when it detects a network connection issue. (#1460)

* We've added the option `ignore_types` to the `uninstall_packaged_incremental` task to allow all components of the specified metadata type to be ignored without having to explicitly list each one.

* The `FindReplace` task now accepts a list of strings for the `file_pattern` option. 

* If the `DeleteData` task fails to delete some rows, this is now reported as an error.

* Robot Framework: Added a new variable `${SELENIUM_SPEED}` that is used to control the speed at which selenium runs when the `Open Test Browser` keyword is called. 

Issues Closed:

* Fixed an issue where existing scratch orgs could sometimes not be used in Windows.

* Fixed a regression where `flow info` and `task info` commands could show an error `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get_service'` when trying to load tasks or flows from a cross-project source. (#1529)

* Fixed an issue where certain HTTP errors while running the bulk data tasks were not reported.


3.5.4 (2020-01-30)
------------------

Changes:

* There is a new top level `cci error` command for interacting with errors in CumulusCI

* `cci gist` is now `cci error gist`

* `cci error info` displays the last 30 lines of a stacktrace from the previous `cci` command run (if present).

* Changed the prompt users receive when encountering errors in `cci`.

Issues Closed:

* Robot Framework: Reverted a change to the `select_record_type` keyword in the Salesforce library to work in both Winter '20 and Spring '20


3.5.3 (2020-01-23)
------------------
* Added new features for running Python code (in a file or string) without bringing up an interactive shell. You can now use `--python` and `--script` arguments for the `cci shell` and `cci org shell` commands.
* Added support for up to two optional parameters in Apex anonymous via token substitution.
* The `EnsureRecordTypes` class is now exposed as `ensure_record_types` and correctly supports the Case, Lead, and Solution sObjects (in addition to other standard objects).
* Fixed a bug where the github_parent_pr_notes was attempting to post comments on issues related to child pull request change notes.
* Fixed various Robot keyword issues that have been reported for Spring '20.


3.5.2 (2020-01-21)
------------------

Issues closed:

* Fixed an issue where errors running the `cci gist` command prompt the user to use the `cci gist` command.

* Removed reference to `os.uname()` so that `cci gist` works on Windows.

* Fixed an issue where the `dx_pull` task causes an infinite loop to occur on Windows.

3.5.1 (2020-01-15)
------------------

Issues closed:

* Fixed an issue that was preventing newlines in output.

* Don't show the prompt to create a gist if the user aborts the process.

* Avoid errors that can happen when trying to store the CumulusCI encryption key in the system keychain using Python's keyring library, which can fail on some systems such as CI systems:

  * We fixed a regression that caused CumulusCI to try to load the keychain even for commands where it's not used.
  * We fixed a bug that caused CumulusCI to try to load the keychain key even when using an unencrypted keychain such as the EnvironmentProjectKeychain.

* Adjusted some keywords in the Salesforce library for Robot Framework to handle changes in the Spring '20 release.

3.5.0 (2020-01-15)
------------------

Changes:

* The ``load_dataset`` task now accepts a ``bulk_mode`` option which can be set to ``Serial`` to load batches serially instead of in parallel.

* CumulusCI now stores the logs from the last five executions under ``~/.cumulusci/logs``

* CumulusCI has a new top-level command: ``cci gist``. This command creates a secret GitHub gist which includes: The user's current CumulusCI version, current Python version, path to python binary, sysname (e.g. Darwin), machine (e.g. x86_64), and the most recent CumulusCI logfile (``~/.cumulusci/logs/cci.log``). The command outputs a link to the created gist and opens a browser tab with the new GitHub gist. This can be helpful for sharing information regarding errors and issues encountered when working with cci. This feature uses a users GitHub access token for creation of gists. If your access token does not have the 'gist (Create gists)' scope this command will result in a 404 error. For more info see: https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html#reporting-error-logs

*  Changed ``UpdateAdminProfile`` so that it only deploys the modified Admin profile. While it is necessary to retrieve profiles along their associated metadata objects, we don't need to do that for deployments.

* Added options to the `deploy` task: ``check_only``, ``test_level``, and ``specified_tests``. Run ``cci task info deploy`` for details. (#1066)

3.4.0 (2020-01-09)
------------------

Changes:

* Added ``activate_flow`` task which can be used to activate Flows and Process Builder processes.

* Added two tasks, ``disable_tdtm_trigger_handlers`` and ``restore_tdtm_trigger_handlers``, which can be used to disable trigger handlers for the table-driven trigger management feature of NPSP and EDA.

* In the ``load_dataset`` task, added a way to avoid resetting the Salesforce Id mapping tables by setting the ``reset_oids`` option to False. This can be useful when running the task multiple times with the same org.

* Added support for a few new metadata types from API versions 47 and 48 in the ``update_package_xml`` task.

* Added a way for Robot Framework libraries to register custom locators for use by the selenium library.

Issues closed:

* Fixed a bug with freezing the ``load_data`` task for MetaDeploy where it would use an invalid option for ``database_url``.

* Fixed a bug in the ``github_release_notes`` task when processing a pull request with no description. (#1444)

* Fixed inaccurate instructions shown at the end of ``cci project init``.

3.3.0 (2019-12-27)
------------------

Breaking changes:

* Removed tasks which are no longer in use: ``mrbelvedere_publish``, ``generate_apex_docs``, and ``commit_apex_docs``.

Changes:

* Updated Robot Framework Salesforce library to support the Spring '20 release.

* Added ``remove_metadata_xml_elements`` task which can be used to remove specified XML elements from metadata files.

* Updated references to the NPSP repository to use its new name instead of Cumulus.

Issues closed:

* Fixed the error message shown when a task config has a bad ``class_path``.

* Fixed a warning when running the command task in Python 3.8.

* When the CumulusCI Robot Framework library calls Salesforce APIs, it will now automatically retry when it is safe to do so. It will also avoid reusing old connections that might have been closed.

* Fixed the ``-o debug True`` option for the ``robot`` task.

3.2.0 (2019-12-11)
------------------

Breaking changes:

* We upgraded the SeleniumLibrary for Robot Framework from version 3.3.1 to version 4.1.0. This includes the removal of some deprecated keywords. See the `SeleniumLibrary releases <https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary/releases>`_ for links to detailed release notes.

Changes:

* The ``Persistent Orgs`` table shown by ``cci org list`` has been renamed to ``Connected Orgs`` since scratch orgs will be shown here if they were connected using ``cci org connect`` instead of created via the Salesforce CLI. This table now shows the org's expiration date, if known.

* Improvements to the ``retrieve_changes`` task:

  * The task now retrieves only the components that actually changed, not all components listed in ``package.xml`` in the target directory.

  * Changes can now be retrieved into folders in DX source format.  The target directory defaults to ``src`` if the project is using ``mdapi`` format or the default entry in ``packageDirectories`` in ``sfdx-project.json`` if the project is using ``sfdx`` format. (Namespace tokenization is not supported in DX format, since there isn't currently a way to deploy DX format source including namespace tokens.)

* Added a task, ``load_custom_settings``, to upload Custom Settings defined in YAML into a target org. See https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bulk_data.html#custom-settings for more info.

Issues closed:

* Fixed an issue with how the package upload task logs Apex test failures to make sure they show up in MetaCI.

* Fixed ``KeyError: createdDate`` error when trying to get scratch org info.

* A rare issue where CumulusCI could fail to load the symbol table for a failed Apex test class is now caught and reported.

* CumulusCI now displays the underlying error if it encounters a problem with storing its encryption key in the system keychain.


3.1.2 (2019-11-20)
------------------

Breaking changes:

* We changed the default path for the mapping file created by the ``generate_dataset_mapping`` task to ``datasets/mapping.yml`` so that it matches the defaults for ``extract_dataset`` and ``load_dataset``

* We changed the ``extract_dataset`` and ``load_dataset`` tasks to default to storing data in an SQL file, ``datasets/sample.sql``, instead of a binary SQLite database file.

Changes:

* ``run_tests`` can now detect and optionally retry two classes of concurrency issues with Apex unit tests. ``run_tests`` should always report an accurate total of test methods run, in parallel or serial mode.

* Added the task ``generate_data_dictionary``. This task indexes the fields and objects created in each GitHub release for the project and generates a data dictionary in CSV format.

* Added a ``devhub`` service. This can be used to switch a project to a non-default sfdx Dev Hub using ``cci service connect devhub --project``

* Added a predefined ``qa`` scratch org. It uses the same scratch org definition file as the ``dev`` org, but makes it easier to spin up a second org for QA purposes without needing to first create it using ``cci org scratch``.

* The ``database_url`` option for the ``extract_dataset`` and ``load_dataset`` tasks is no longer required. Either ``database_url`` or ``sql_path`` must be specified. If both are specified, the ``sql_path`` will be ignored.

* Developers can now directly execute CumulusCI from the Python command line using ``python -m cumulusci`` or ``python cumulusci/__main__.py``

Issues closed:

* A problem with how ``run_tests`` performed Apex test retries when ``retry_always`` is set to True has been corrected.


3.1.1 (2019-11-13)
------------------

New features:

* After connecting an org with ``cci org connect``, the browser now shows the message
  "Congratulations! Your authentication succeeded." instead of "OK"
* External GitHub sources can now specify ``release: latest``, ``release: latest_beta``,
  or ``release: previous`` instead of a commit, branch, or tag.
* The ``execute_anon`` task has been revised to detect when a gack occurred during execution.

Issues closed:

* When importing a scratch org from sfdx using ``cci org import``, the org's ``days``
  is now set correctly from the org's actual expiration date. (#1101)
* The package API version from ``cumulusci.yml`` is now validated to make sure
  it's in the "XX.0" format expected by the API. (#1134)
* Fixed an error deploying new setting objects using the ``org_settings`` task in Winter '20.
* Fixed a bug in processing preflight check tasks for MetaDeploy.
* Fixed path handling in the ``update_admin_profile`` task when run in a cross-project flow.


3.1.0 (2019-11-01)
------------------

Breaking changes:

* The ``metadeploy_publish`` task now requires setting ``-o publish True``
  in order to automatically set the Version's is_listed flag to True.
  (This is backwards incompatible in order to provide a safer default.)

New features:

* Python 3.8 is now officially supported.

* Flows can now include tasks or flows from a different project.
  See `Using Tasks and Flows from a Different Project
  <https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html>`_ for details.

* In the ``metadeploy_publish`` task it is now possible to specify a
  commit hash with ``-o commit [sha]``, instead of a tag. This is useful
  while MetaDeploy plans are in development.

* Bulk data:

  * Added support for mapping Record Types between orgs (by Developer Name)
    during bulk data extract and load.
  * Added support for Record Type mapping in the ``generate_dataset_mapping`` task.
  * Added `new documentation <https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bulk_data.html>`_
    for bulk data tasks.

* Robot Framework:

  * The sample ``create_contact.robot`` test that is created when initializing
    a new project with ``cci project init`` now makes use of page objects.
  * The page objects library has two new keywords, ``wait for modal`` and
    ``wait for page object``, which wait for a new page object to appear.
  * ``cumulusci.robotframework.utils`` now has a decorator named
    ``capture_screenshot_on_error`` which can be used to automatically capture
    a screenshot when a keyword fails.
  * Prior to this change, ``Go to page  Detail  Contact`` required you to use
    a keyword argument for the object id
    (eg: ``Go to page  Detail  Contact  object_id=${object_id}``).
    You can now specify the object id as a positional parameter
    (eg: ``Go to page  Detail  Contact  ${object_id}``).

* ``OrgConfig`` objects now have a ``latest_api_version`` property which
  can be used to check what Salesforce API version is available.

Issues closed:

* Updated the scratch org definition files generated by ``cci project init``
  to the new recommended format for org settings. Thanks to @umeditor for the fix.

* The ``create_unmanaged_ee_src`` task (part of the ``unmanaged_ee`` flow)
  has been revised to remove the Protected setting on Custom Objects,
  to ensure that projects using this setting can be deployed to an Enterprise Edition org.

* The Salesforce REST API client used by many tasks will now automatically
  retry requests on certain connection and HTTP errors.

* Fixed an issue where posts to the Metadata API could reuse an existing connection
  and get a connection reset error if Salesforce had closed the connection.

* Disabled use of PyOpenSSL by the Python requests library, since it is no longer
  needed in the versions of Python we support.

3.0.2 (2019-10-17)
------------------

Issues closed:

* Fixed a bug in deploying email templates and dashboards that was introduced
  in 3.0.1.
* Removed broken ``config_qa`` flow from the ``cci project init`` template.

3.0.1 (2019-10-16)
------------------

New features:

* Added support for new metadata types when generating ``package.xml``
  from a directory of metadata using the ``update_package_xml`` task.

* The ``ci_feature`` flow now supports generating change notes for a
  parent feature branch's pull request from the notes on child pull requests.
  The parent pull request description will be overwritten with the new notes
  after a child branch is merged to the parent if the parent pull request has
  a special label, ``Build Change Notes``.

* When running Apex tests with the ``run_tasks`` task, if there is a single
  remaining class being run, its name will be logged.

* Apex test failures that happen while uploading a package are now logged.

* In the ``robot_libdoc`` task, wildcards can now be used in the ``path`` option.

* Added an ``org_settings`` task which can deploy scratch org settings
  from a scratch org definition file.

Issues closed:

* Added a workaround for an issue where refreshing the access token for a sandbox
  or scratch org could fail if the user's credentials were new and not fully propagated.

3.0.0 (2019-09-30)
------------------

Breaking change:

* CumulusCI 3.0.0 removes support for Python 2 (which will reach end of life at the end of 2019).
  If you're still running Python 2 you can use an older version of CumulusCI,
  but we recommend upgrading to Python 3. See our
  `installation instructions <https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_
  for your platform.

2.5.9 (2019-09-26)
------------------

New features:

* Added a Domain column to the list of scratch orgs in ``cci org list``. (thanks @bethbrains)

* Tasks related to Salesforce Communities (thanks @MatthewBlanski)
    * New ``list_community_templates`` task
    * New ``list_communities`` task
    * New ``publish_community`` task
    * The ``create_community`` task can now be used to create a community with no URL prefix,
      as long as one does not already exist.

* Robot Framework:
    * Added keywords for generating a collection of sObjects according to a template:
        * ``Generate Test Data``
        * ``Salesforce Collection Insert``
        * ``Salesforce Collection Update``
    * Changes to Page Objects:
        * More than one page object can be loaded at once.
          Once loaded, the keywords of a page object remain visible in the suite.
          Robot will give priority to keywords in the reverse order in which they were imported.
        * There is a new keyword, ``Log Current Page Object``,
          which can be useful to see information about the most recently loaded page object.
        * There is a new keyword, ``Get Page Object``,
          which will return the robot library for a given page object.
          This can be used in other keywords to access keywords from another page object if necessary.
        * The ``Go To Page`` keyword will now automatically load the page object for the given page.
    * Added a basic debugger for Robot tests. It can be enabled
      using the ``-o debug True`` option to the robot task.

* Added support for deploying new metadata types ``ProfilePasswordPolicy`` and ``ProfileSessionSetting``.

Issues closed:

* Fixed a bug where the ``batch_apex_wait`` task would sometimes fail to conclude that the batch was complete.
* Fixed a bug in rendering tables in Python 2.

2.5.8 (2019-09-13)
------------------

New features:

* ``LoadData`` now supports the key ``action: update`` to perform a Bulk API update job
* ``LoadData`` now supports an ``after: <step name>`` on a lookup entry to defer updating that lookup until a dependent sObject step is completed.
* ``GenerateMapping`` now handles self-lookups and reference cycles by generating ``after:`` markers wherever needed. 

Issues closed:

* Patch selenium to convert ``executeScript`` to ``executeAsyncScript``. This is a workaround for the ``executeScript`` issue in chromedriver 77.
* A small issue in ``QueryData`` affecting mappings using ``oid_as_pk: False`` has been fixed.

2.5.7 (2019-09-03)
------------------

Breaking changes:

* The ``retries``, ``retry_interval``, and ``retry_interval_add`` options have been removed from the ``run_tests`` task. These were misleading as they did not actually retry failing tests.

New features:

* The ``run_tests`` task now supports a ``retry_failures`` parameter. This is a list of regular expressions to match against each unit test failure's message and stack trace; if all failing tests match, the failing tests will be retried serially. Set ``retry_always`` to True to trigger this behavior when any failure matches.
* There is now a default CumulusCI global connected app that can be used to connect to persistent orgs (assuming you know the credentials) without creating a new connected app. It's still possible to configure a custom connected app using ``cci service connect connected_app`` if more control over the connected app settings is needed.
* When CumulusCI is being run in a non-interactive context it can now obtain an access token for a persistent org using a JWT instead of a refresh token. This approach is used if the SFDX_CLIENT_ID and SFDX_HUB_KEY environment variables are set. This makes it easier to manage persistent org connections in the context of a hosted service because it's possible to replace the connected app's certificate without needing to obtain new refresh tokens for each org.

Issues closed:

* Fixed a bug where showing the summary of flow steps would break with sub-steps in MetaDeploy.
* Fixed a bug in the caching of preflight task results in MetaDeploy.

2.5.6 (2019-08-15)
------------------

New features:

* We've changed how the output of some commands are displayed in tables.
  For users that prefer simpler style tables we've added a ``--plain`` option
  to approximate the previous behavior. To permanently set this option,
  add this in ``~/.cumulusci/cumulusci.yml``::

    cli:
        plain_output: True

* Added additional info to the ``cci version`` command, including the Python version,
  an upgrade check, and a warning on Python 2.
* Improved the summary of flow steps that is shown at the start of running a flow.
* The ``github_release_notes`` task now has an ``include_empty`` option
  to include links to pull requests that have no release notes.
  This is enabled by default when this task is called as part of the ``release_beta`` flow.
* Robot Framework:

  * Added locators file to support the Winter '20 release of Salesforce.
  * New ``robot_lint`` task to check for common problems in Robot Framework test suites.
  * The ``Open Test Browser`` keyword will now log details about the browser.
  * Added a new keyword to the CumulusCI library, ``Get Community Info``.
    It can be used to get information about a Community by name via the Salesforce API.

Issues closed:

* Added workarounds for some intermittent 401 errors when authenticating to the GitHub API as a GitHub App.
* ``cci org info`` shouldn't show traceback if the org isn't found (#1023)

2.5.5 (2019-07-31)
------------------

New features:

* Add the ``cci org shell`` command, which opens a Python shell pre-populated with a simple_salesforce session on the selected org (as ``sf``).
* The ``cci flow info`` command now shows nested subflows.
* Added the ``create_community`` task allowing for API-based Community creation.
* Added the ``generate_dataset_mapping`` task to generate a Bulk Data mapping file for a package.
* CumulusCI can now authenticate for GitHub API calls as either a user or an app. The latter is for use when CumulusCI is used as part of a hosted service.
* The ``OrgConfig`` object now provides access to the Organization SObject data via the ``organization_sobject`` attribute.

Issues closed:

* The ``install_regression`` flow now upgrades to the latest beta from the most recent final release instead of from the previous final release.
* Made sure that an ``errorMessage`` returned from a metadata API deploy will be reported.
* The ``load_dataset`` task will now stop with an exception if any records fail during the load operation.

2.5.4 (2019-07-03)
------------------

* Updated the default API version for new projects to 46.0
* Fixed a bug in reporting scratch org creation errors encountered while running a flow.
* Fixed the ``snapshot_changes`` and ``list_changes`` tasks to avoid breaking when the last revision number of a component is null.

2.5.3 (2019-06-24)
------------------

Breaking changes:

* Added two new options to the UpdateDependencies task:

  * ``allow_newer``: If the org already has a newer release, use it. Defaults to True.
  * ``allow_uninstalls``: Allow uninstalling a beta release or newer final release if needed in order to install the requested version. Defaults to False.

  These defaults are a change from prior behavior since uninstalling packages is not commonly needed when working with scratch orgs, and it is potentially destructive.

New features:

* Added support for defining and evaluating preflight checks for MetaDeploy plans.
* The tasks for bulk data extract and load are now configured by default as ``extract_data`` and ``load_data``.
* Updated the project template created by ``cci project init``:

  * Added ``.gitignore``, ``README.md``, and a template for GitHub pull requests
  * Added an option to store metadata in DX source format
  * Added a sample ``mapping.yml`` for the bulk data tasks
  * Specify the currently installed CumulusCI version as the project's ``minimum_cumulusci_version``
  * Check to make sure the project name only contains supported characters

* The ``robot_libdoc`` task can now generate documentation for Robot Framework page objects.

Issues fixed:

* Colors in terminal output are now displayed correctly in Windows. (#813)
* ``cci`` no longer prints tracebacks when a flow or task is not found.
  Additionally, it will suggest a name if a close enough match can be found. (#960)
* Fixed UnicodeDecodeError when reading output from subprocesses if the console encoding is different from Python's preferred file encoding.
* Fixes related to source tracking:

  * Track the max revision retrieved for each component instead of the overall max revision.
    This way components can be retrieved in stages into different paths.
  * If ``snapshot_changes`` doesn't find any changes, wait 5 seconds and try again.
    There can be a delay after a deployment before source tracking is updated.

2.5.2 (2019-06-10)
------------------

Issues fixed:

* When generating package.xml, translate ``___NAMESPACE___`` tokens in filenames into ``%%%NAMESPACE%%%`` tokens in package.xml (#1104).
* Avoid extraneous output when ``--json`` output was requested (#1103).
* Display OS notification when a task or flow completes even if it failed.
* Robot Framework: Added logic to retry the initial page load if it is not loading successfully.
* Internal API change: Errors while processing a response from the Metadata API are now raised as MetadataParseError.

2.5.1 (2019-05-31)
------------------

Issues fixed:

* Fixed ``cci service connect`` when run outside of a directory containing a CumulusCI project.

2.5.0 (2019-05-25)
------------------

Breaking changes:

* We reorganized the flows for setting up a package for regression testing for better symmetry with other flows.
  If you were running the ``install_regression`` flow before, you now probably want ``regression_org``.

  Details: The ``install_regression`` flow now installs the package _without_ configuring it.
  There is a new ``config_regression`` flow to configure the package (it defaults to calling ``config_managed``)
  and a ``regression_org`` flow that includes both ``install_regression`` and ``config_regression``.

New features:

* CumulusCI now has experimental support for deploying projects in `DX source format <https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_source_file_format.htm>`_.
  To enable this, set ``source_format: sfdx`` in the project section of ``cumulusci.yml``.
  CumulusCI will deploy DX-format projects to scratch orgs using ``sfdx force:source:push`` and to other orgs using the Metadata API (by converting to metadata source format in a temporary directory).
* Setting a default org in CumulusCI (using ``cci org default`` or the ``--default`` flag when creating a scratch org) will now also update the sfdx ``defaultusername``. (#868)
* When connecting to GitHub using ``cci service connect github``, CumulusCI will now check to make sure the credentials are valid before saving them.
* Robot Framework:

  * Added a framework for creating "page object" classes to contain keywords related to a particular page or component.
  * The ``robot`` task now takes a ``name`` option to control the name of the robot suite in output.
  * Updates to the keyword ``Open Test Browser``:

    * It allows you to open more than one browser in a single test case. (#1068)
    * It sets the default size for the browser window to 1280x1024.
    * Added a new keyword argument ``size`` to override the default size.
    * Added a new keyword argument ``alias`` to let you assign an alias to multiple browser windows.

Issues fixed:

* Robot Framework: Fixed a bug where the ``Delete Session Records`` keyword would skip deleting some records. (#973)
* If Salesforce returns an error response while refreshing an OAuth token, CumulusCI will now show the response instead of just the HTTP status code.
* Fixed a bug in reporting errors from the Metadata API if the response contains ``componentFailures`` with no ``problem`` or ``problemType``.


2.4.4 (2019-05-09)
------------------

New features:

* Added tasks ``list_changes`` and ``retrieve_changes`` which interact with source tracking in scratch orgs to handle retrieving changed metadata as Metadata API format source.
* Added task ``EnsureRecordTypes`` to generate a Record Type and optional Business Process for a specific sObject and deploy the metadata, if the object does not already have Record Types.
* The ``update_admin_profile`` task now uses Python string formatting on the ``package.xml`` file used for retrieve. This allows injection of namespace prefixes using ``{managed}`` and ``{namespaced_org}``.

Issues fixed:

* If CumulusCI gets a connection error while trying to call the Salesforce Metadata API, it will now retry several times before giving up.
* The GitHub release notes parser now recognizes Issues Closed if they are linked in Markdown format.
* Robot Framework: Fixed a locator used by the ``Select App Launcher App`` keyword to work in Summer '19.
* The ``cci project init`` command now uses an updated repository URL when extending EDA.

2.4.3 (2019-04-26)
------------------

* Allow configuration of the email address assigned to scratch org users, with the order of priority being (1) any ``adminEmail`` key in the scratch org definition; (2) the ``email_address`` property on the scratch org configuration in ``cumulusci.yml``; (3) the ``user.email`` configuration property in Git.
* CumulusCI can now handle building static resource bundles (``*.resource``) while deploying using the Metadata API. To use this option, specify the ``static_resource_path`` option for the deploy task. Any subdirectory in this path will be turned into a resource file and added to the package during deployment. There must be a corresponding ``*.resource-meta.xml`` file for each static resource bundle.
* Bulk data tasks: Fixed a bug that added extra underscores to field names when processing lookups.
* Robot Framework: The Salesforce library now has the ability to switch between different sets of locators based on the Salesforce version, and thanks to it we've fixed the robot so it can click on modal buttons in the Summer '19 release.
* The ``cci project init`` command now generates projects with a different preferred structure for Robot Framework tests and resources, with everything inside the ``robot`` directory. Existing projects with tests in the ``tests`` directory should continue to work.

2.4.2 (2019-04-22)
------------------

* The ``purgeOnDelete`` flag for the ``deploy`` task will now automatically be set to false when
  deploying metadata to production orgs (previously deployment would fail on production orgs
  if this flag was true).
* The installation documentation now recommends using ``pipx`` to install CumulusCI on Windows,
  so that you don't have to set up a virtualenv manually.

2.4.1 (2019-04-09)
------------------

Changes:

* Updated the default Salesforce Metadata API version to 45.0
* The scratch org definition files generated by ``cci project init`` now use ``orgPreferenceSettings`` instead of the deprecated ``orgPreferences``.
* The ``metadeploy_publish`` task now defaults to describing tasks based on ``Deploy`` as "metadata" steps instead of "other".

Issues Fixed:

* Fixed a couple problems with generating passwords for new scratch orgs:

  * A project's predefined scratch org configs now default to ``set_password: True`` (which was already the case for orgs created explicitly using cci org scratch).
  * A scratch org config's ``set_password`` flag is now retained when recreating an expired org. (Fixes #670)

* Fixed the logic for finding the most recent GitHub release so that it now only considers tags that start with the project's git ``prefix_release``.
* Fixed the ``install_prod_no_config`` flow. The ``deploy_post`` task was not injecting namespace tokens correctly.
* Fixed the ``connected_app`` task to work with version 7 of the sfdx CLI. (Fixes #1013)
* Robot Framework: Fixed the ``Populate Field`` keyword to work around intermittent problems clearing existing field values.

2.4.0 (2019-03-18)
------------------

Critical changes:

* If you are publishing installation plans to MetaDeploy, there have been some significant changes:

    * Plan options are now read from a new ``plans`` section of ``cumulusci.yml`` instead of from task options. This means that a single run of the task can now handle publishing multiple plans, and there is now a generic ``metadeploy_publish`` task which can be used instead of setting up different tasks for each project.
    * Plan steps are now defined inline in the plan configuration rather than by naming a flow. This makes it easier to configure a plan that is like an existing flow with one or two adjustments.
    * There is now a way to customize MetaDeploy step settings such as ``name`` and ``is_required`` on a step-by-step basis, using ``ui_options`` in the plan config.
    * The task will now find or create a ``PlanTemplate`` as necessary, matching existing PlanTemplates on the product and plan name. This means the plan config no longer needs to reference a plan template by id, which makes it easier to publish to multiple instances of MetaDeploy.

* The ``install_upgrade`` flow was renamed to ``install_regression`` to better reflect the use case it is focused on. There are also a few updates to what it does:

    * It will now install the latest beta release of managed packages instead of the latest final release.
    * It now runs the ``config_managed`` flow after upgrading the managed package, so that it will work if this flow has references to newly added components.

Changes:

* Added support for deploying Lightning Web Components.

* Fixed the bulk data load task to handle null values in a datetime column.

* The `ci_master` flow now explicitly avoids trying to install beta releases of dependencies (since it's meant for use with non-scratch orgs and we block installing betas there since they can't be upgraded).

2.3.4 (2019-03-06)
------------------

* Added a new flow, ``install_upgrade``, which can be used for testing package upgrades.
  It installs and configures the _previous_ release of the package, then installs the latest release.
* Fixed an error when using ``cci org info --json`` (fixes #1013).

2.3.3 (2019-02-28)
------------------

* Fixed a bug where flow options specified on the command line were not passed to tasks correctly.
* ``cci service connect`` now shows a more helpful error message if you call it with a service name that CumulusCI doesn't know about. Fixes #752.
* Deleted scratch orgs will no longer show the number of days since they were created in ``cci org list``. Thanks to @21aslade for the fix.
* Updates to the MetaDeploy publish task:

  * It is now possible to publish a new plan for an existing version.
  * It is now possible to specify the AllowedList to which a plan is visible.

* Updates to Robot Framework support:

  * Fixed a bug in the ``robot`` task: it now accepts an option called ``test`` rather than ``tests``, since the latter was ignored by Robot Framework.
  * Fixed some stability problems with the ``Populate Field`` keyword.
  * The ``robot_libdoc`` task has been replaced with a new task of the same name that can generate a single HTML document for multiple keyword files by passing a comma-separated list of files to the ``path`` option.

2.3.2 (2019-02-19)
------------------

* Mapping enhancements for bulk ``QueryData`` and ``LoadData`` tasks
  
  * The mapping yaml file no longer requires using ``Id: sf_id`` as a field mapping.  If not provided, ``QueryData`` and ``LoadData`` will use local database ids instead of Saleforce OIDs for storing lookup relationships.  Previous mappings which specify the ``Id: sf_id`` mapping will continue to work as before using the Salesforce OID as the mapping value.
  * The mapping yaml file's ``lookups:`` section now handles defaults to allow simpler lookup mappings.  The only key required is now ``table``.  If the ``key_field`` is provided it will be used.

* The ``sql_path`` option on ``QueryData`` can be used to provide the file path where a SQL script should be written.  If this option is used, a sqlite in-memory database is used and discarded.  This is useful for storing data sets in a Github repository and allowing diffs of the dataset to be visible when reviewing Pull Requests
  
  * When using this option, it is best to make sure your mapping yaml file does not provide a field mapping for the ``Id`` field.  This will help avoid merge conflicts if querying data from different orgs such as scratch orgs.

* The `sql_path` option on ``LoadData`` can be used to provide the file path where a SQL script file should be read and used to load an in-memory sqlite database for the load operation.

2.3.1 (2019-02-15)
------------------

* Fixed a bug that caused the ``cci`` command to check for a newer version on every run, rather than occasionally. Also we now detect whether CumulusCI was installed using Homebrew and recommend an upgrade command accordingly.
* CumulusCI now automatically generates its own keychain key and stores it in the system keychain (using the Python `keyring` library). This means that it is no longer necessary to specify a CUMULUSCI_KEY as an environment variable. (However, the environment variable will still be preferred if it is there, and it will be migrated to the system keychain.)
* New task ``connected_app`` makes it easier to deploy and configure the Connected App needed for CumulusCI's keychain to work with persistent orgs.  The connected app is deployed using ``sfdx`` to an org in the ``sfdx`` keychain and defaults to the ``defaultdevhubusername``.
* The ``robot`` task gives a more helpful error message if you forget to specify an org.
* Updates to the task for publishing to MetaDeploy:

  * Dependency installation steps are now named using the package name and version.
  * The task options have been revised to match changes in the MetaDeploy API. An optional ``plan_template_id`` is now accepted. ``preflight_message`` is now named ``preflight_message_additional`` and is optional. ``post_install_message`` is now named ``post_install_message_additional`` and is optional.

2.3.0 (2019-02-04)
------------------

Changes:

* When installing a managed package dependency, pre & post metadata bundles are now fetched from the git commit corresponding to the most recent release of the managed package, instead of master.
* Improvements to the task for publishing a release to MetaDeploy:
  * It can now publish a tag even if it's a different commit than what is currently checked out in the working directory.
  * It now pins managed deployments of metadata bundles to the git commit corresponding to the most recent release of the managed package.

Issues Closed:

* #962: ``cumulusci.utils.findReplace`` uses wrong file encoding in Python 3
* #967: Allow ``cci service`` commands to be run from outside a project repository

2.3.0b1 (2019-01-28)
--------------------

Breaking Changes:

* We refactored the code for running flows. The full list of steps to run is now calculated from nested flow configuration when the flow is initialized instead of during runtime. Your existing flows should continue to run as before, but if you're interacting with CumulusCI at the Python API level, you'll need to use the ``FlowCoordinator`` instead of ``BaseFlow``.
* Tasks are now expected to have no side effects when they are instantiated. If tasks need to set up resources, do that in ``_init_task`` instead of ``__init__`` or ``_init_options`` to make sure it doesn't happen until the task is actually being run.

Changes:

* There is now a ``dev_org_beta_deps`` flow which sets up an org in the same way as ``dev_org``, but installs the latest beta versions of managed package dependencies.
* The ``github_release`` task now records the release dependencies as JSON in the release's tag message.
* Looking up the latest release from GitHub is now done using a single HTTP request rather than listing all releases.
* We added S-Controls to the list of metadata types that the ``uninstall_packaged_incremental`` task will delete.
* Salesforce Robot Framework library: The ``Get Current Record Id`` keyword now parses the Id correctly when prefixed with ``%2F``, which apparently happens.
* The ``push_failure_report`` task now avoids an error when querying for info about lots of subscriber orgs.

Issues Closed:

* #911: Fix UnicodeDecodeError when parsing XML retrieved from the Metadata API.

2.2.6 (2019-01-03)
------------------

Changes:

* Added support for more metadata types: Group, SharingSet, SharingCriteriaRule, SharingOwnerRule, and SharingTerritoryRule.
* Release process: We now have tools in place to release cumulusci so that it can be installed using Homebrew or Linuxbrew.

Issues Closed:

* Fixed an issue where tasks using the Salesforce REST API could build a wrong URL with an extra slash after the instance URL.
* Fixed an issue where overriding a flow step to set flow: None did not work.
* Robot Framework: Added an automatic retry to work around an issue with an intermittent ConnectionResetError when connecting to headless Chrome in Python 3.

2.2.5 (2018-12-26)
------------------

* The ``install_managed`` and ``install_managed_beta`` tasks now take optional ``activateRSS`` and ``password`` options. ``activateRSS`` is set to true by default so that any active Remote Site Settings in the package will remain active when installed.

* When running a task with the ``--debug`` flag, HTTP requests are now logged.

* Robot Framework:

  * Fix issue where "Get Current Record Id" could accidentally match the object name instead of the record Id.
  * Fix issue where "Load Related List" would fail to scroll down to the list.
  * Fix issue where errors deleting records during test teardown would cause a hidden test failure.


2.2.4 (2018-12-17)
------------------

Changes:

* Bulk query task:

  * Fixed an issue with querying data filtered by record type (#904).
  * Fixed an issue where the optimized approach for loading data into PostgreSQL was not used.
  * The task will now prevent you from accidentally overwriting existing data by exiting with an error if the table already exists.

* The ``deploy`` task now logs the size of the zip payload in bytes.

* Fixed a TypeError in the ``commit_apex_docs`` task (#901).

* Robot Framework:

  * Add location strategies for locating elements by text and by title.

2.2.3 (2018-12-07)
------------------

Changes:

* Improved error messages when scratch org creation failed and when a service is not configured.
* Robot Framework: Limit how long the "Load Related List" keyword will wait.

2.2.2 (2018-11-27)
------------------

Changes:

* Improved error handling during scratch org creation:

  * Capture and display stderr output from SFDX (issue #413).
  * Avoid infinite recursion if username wasn't found in output from SFDX.

* Robot Framework: Increased the timeout for initial loading of the browser.


2.2.1 (2018-11-21)
------------------

Oops, an update in CumulusCI 2.2.0 ended up breaking the update_dependencies task! Now fixed.

2.2.0 (2018-11-21)
------------------

Changes:

* Tasks can now be placed in groups for the task list! Just specify a ``group`` when defining the task in YAML.

* By popular request, there is now an ``org import`` command to import an org from the SFDX keychain to the CumulusCI keychain. It takes two arguments: the SFDX username or alias, and the org name.

* Robot Framework:

  * The ``Populate Field`` keyword now clears an existing value using keystrokes to make sure that change events are fired.
  * Added a ``Get Namespace Prefix`` keyword to the CumulusCI library to get the namespace prefix for a package.
  * Fixed a bug that broke opening a browser after using the ``Run Task`` keyword.

* Documentation updates:

  * The readme now includes a link to the full documentation.
  * The instructions for installing CumulusCI on macOS have been simplified and now recommend using the official Python installer from python.org instead of Homebrew. (Homebrew should still work fine, but is no longer necessary.) We also now suggest creating a virtualenv using venv rather than pyenv since the former is included with Python. It's fine to continue using pyenv if you want.
  * Give more useful links for how to set up SFDX.
  * Updated robot library docs.

* Internal refactoring:

  * Removed dependency on HiYaPyCo for YAML loading, which would not report which file failed to load in the event of a YAML parse error.
  * We now consistently load YAML in the same manner throughout the entire library, which will work with all supported Python versions.
  * Simplified the Python API for setting up a CumulusCI runtime. Begone, YamlGlobalConfig and YamlProjectConfig. Our Python API is not yet documented, but we're working on it. In the meantime, if you were relying on running CCI from within Python, you can now just use BaseGlobalConfig (and its get_project_config member) to bootstrap CCI.
  * BaseProjectConfig has shrugged off some methods that just delegated to the keychain.
  * BaseGlobalConfig has shrugged off some unimplemented methods, and BaseGlobalConfig.get_project_config is now deprecated in favor of using a runtime.
  * Introducing... 🥁CumulusCIRuntime! In order to alleviate the complexities of getting CumulusCI tasks/flows running from within a Python application, CumulusCIRuntime encapsulates a lot of the details and wiring between Keychain, GlobalConfig, and ProjectConfig. Usage docs are barely included.
  * CliConfig has been renamed to CliRuntime and now inherits from CumulusCIRuntime. It is still accessible as CliConfig.
  * Upgraded dependencies.

* Contributor improvement: The contributor docs now explain how to install pre-commit hooks to make sure our linters have run before you commit.

Issues Closed:

* #674: ``cci org import <username> <org_name>``
* #877: CumulusCI should be able to connect to any DX alias and/or understand dx auth files

2.1.2 (2018-10-29)
------------------

Oops, we broke a few things! This is a bugfix release to fix a few issues found during the Salesforce.org Open Source Community Sprint last week.

Issues Closed:

* #858 Dataload bulk query fails to load data into the sqlite db
* #862 CLI options fail on robot task in 2.1.1
* #864 Deploying a -meta.xml file with non-ASCII characters breaks in Python 2

2.1.1 (2018-10-23)
------------------

Changes:

* Our robotframework library for Salesforce got a number of improvements:

  * New keywords:

    * ``Click Header Field Link``: Clicks a link in a record header
    * ``Load Related List``: Scrolls to a related list and waits for it to load
    * ``Click Related List Button``: Clicks a button in the header of a related list
    * ``Click Related Item Link``: Clicks the main link for an item in a related list
    * ``Click Related Item Popup Link``: Clicks a link in the popup menu for an item in a related list

  * Updated to ``robotframework-seleniumlibrary`` 3.2.0 which includes a ``Scroll Element Into View`` keyword.
  * ``Wait Until Loading Is Complete`` now waits for the main body of the page to render
  * ``Populate Lookup Field`` now tries several times in case there's an indexing delay
  * Added a ``-o verbose True`` option to the robot task which logs each keyword as it runs.
  * We now ignore errors while running the script that waits for XHRs to complete
    (it can fail if the page reloads before the script finishes).

* Popup notifications upon completion of a flow or task now work on Linux too,
  if you have the ``notify-send`` command from libnotify.
  On Ubuntu, install the ``notify-osd`` package.

Issues Closed:

* #827 Bulk data load breaks in Python 2
* #832 pip install cumulusci gets the wrong version of urllib3

2.1.1b1 (2018-10-17)
--------------------

* ``uninstall_packaged_incremental`` task: Added ``ignore`` option to specify components to skip trying to delete even if they are present in the org but not in the local source.

2.1.0 (2018-10-16)
------------------

* Fixed the ``cci project init`` command, which was failing because it wanted
  the project to already exist! Fixes #816. In addition, other commands
  will now function without an active project or keychain when it possible
  to do so. (For example, try ``cci version`` which now works when you're
  not in a project directory.)
* ``update_dependencies`` task:
    * Added support for installing private github repositories as dependencies.
      Thanks to Anthony Backhouse (@1handclapping) for the patch. Fixes #793
    * Added a ``dependencies`` option to override the project dependencies.
* ``execute_apex`` task:
    * Print more useful error messages when there are Apex exceptions.
* ``robot`` task:
    * Our logic for automatically retrying failed selenium commands has been
      encapsulated into the ``cumulusci.robotframework.utils.selenium_retry``
      decorator which can be applied to a robot library class for increased
      stability.
    * There is now an option to pause and enter the Python debugger
      after a keyword fails. Run with ``-o pdb True``.
    * Revised keywords and locators to support the Winter '19 release of Salesforce
      and improve stability.
    * The ``Salesforce.robot`` file now includes the ``OperatingSystem`` and ``XML``
      libraries from Robot Framework by default. These libraries are helpful in
      building integration tests such as modifying and deploying a PageLayout
      to include a field needed in Suite Setup of an integration test.
* Revised installation instructions for Windows. Thanks Matthew Blanski (@Auchtor).
* Internal change: Use a thread-local variable instead of a global to track the current running task.

2.1.0b1 (2018-10-05)
--------------------

* It's happening! Hot on the heels of the last release, CumulusCI is making the jump to the modern era by adding **support for Python 3**! (Specifically, Python 3.6 and 3.7.) Don't worry, we'll also continue to support Python 2 for the time being. Because this is a bit more wide-reaching change than normal, we're releasing a beta first. To install the beta you'll need to explicitly request its version: ``pip install cumulusci==2.1.0b1``.
  If you already have CumulusCI, after the update it will continue to run under your Python 2 interpreter. If you want to switch to the Python 3 interpreter (which is not yet required), we recommend deleting
  your Python virtualenv and starting over with the instructions in the `tutorial <https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html>`_.  If you want to keep your Python 2-based virtualenv around just in case, follow those instructions but name the new virtualenv ``cci-py3`` instead of ``cci``.
* There are also some big changes to the **bulk data** tasks. Did you know CumulusCI has bulk data tasks? They are not configured by default, because we need to finish documenting them. But we'll list the changes in case someone is already relying on them:
  * Fixed connection resets by downloading an entire result file before processing.
  * Improved performance by processing batches in parallel, avoiding the SQLAlchemy ORM, storing inserted Ids in separate tables, and doing lookups using SQL joins rather than a separate query for each row.
  * If you're using a postgres database for local storage, performance gets even better by taking advantage of postgres' ``COPY`` command to load CSV directly.
  * Added a ``hardDelete`` option for bulk deletes.
  * Added a ``start_step`` option for bulk loads which can be used to resume loading after an error.
* The ``push_failure_report`` task will now by default hide failures that occurred due to the "Package Uninstalled" or "Salesforce Subscription Expired" errors, which are generally benign.
* Fixed the check for newer CumulusCI versions to work around an issue with old ``setuptools``.
* Contributor change: We switched CumulusCI's own tests to run using ``pytest``.
* Internal change: We switched to the ``cryptography`` library for handling keychain encryption.

2.0.13 (2018-10-02)
-------------------
* Happy Spooky October! It's unlucky release 2.0.13, with some scary-cool improvements. Just to show you how ramped up our RelEng team is now, this release had TWENTY THREE pull requests in 12 days! From all four of your friendly SFDO Release Engineering committers. Thanks so much for continuing to use CCI for all your Salesforce automation needs.
* NEW FLOW: ci_beta_dependencies installs the latest beta of project dependencies and run tests. Includes task error when running against non-scratch orgs.
* NEW TASK: ReportPushFailures pulls a list of Package Push Upgrade Request failures after a push attempt, including grouping by important factors.
* Issue a terminal "Bell" sound and attempt to display a macOS notification when a commandline task or flow completes.
* Cleaned up python exception and error handling across the board, so that we can provide you, the user, with only the most relevant information. Try using CCI without setting your CUMULUSCI_KEY and see a simplified error message.
* Fixed the utils for processing namespaces in package zip files to handle non-ASCII characters
* The CONTRIBUTING.rst docs and Makefile have been updated to show how we release updates of CCI.
* Skip beta releases when checking for a newer cumulusci version
* When using the strip_namespace option on deployments, we now log which files had changes made before deploying.
* Going Out: the SFDXDeploy and SFDXJsonPollingTasks have been removed, as they didn't work.
* Going Out: Use the safe_load() method when loading YAML instead of the naive load(). If you relied on executing code in your CCI YAML file parsing, that will no longer work.

2.0.12 (2018-09-20)
-------------------

* Fixed apexdoc URL
* Fixed `update_admin_profile` to set any existing record type defaults to false before setting new defaults.
* Fixed deployment of -meta.xml files containing non-ASCII characters.
* Updated the robot selector for "Click Modal Button" to work for modals opened by a Quick Action.

2.0.11 (2018-09-14)
-------------------

* `update_admin_profile` now uses xml parsing instead of string replacement for more targeted editing of Admin.profile to fix issues with deploying record types via dependencies
* Projects can declare a dependency on a minimum version of cumulusci by specifying `minimum_cumulusci_version` in cumulusci.yml

2.0.10 (2018-09-13)
-------------------

* `update_admin_profile` task now sets application and tab visibility and supports setting record type visibility and default via the new `record_types` task option
* Restructured exceptions to include two new parent exceptions useful in client implementations:

  * CumulusCIFailure: Used to signify a failure rather than an error, such as test or metadata deployment failures
  * CumulusCIUsageError: Use to signify a usage error such as accessing a task that does not exist

* `execute_anon` task now accepts either `apex` (string) or `path` (Apex in a local file) for the Apex to execute.  Also, the `managed` and `namespaced` options allow injecting namespace prefixes into the Apex to be executed.

* New flow `retrieve_scratch` can be used to retrieve declarative changes from a scratch org into the src/ directory

2.0.9 (2018-09-10)
------------------

* Make robot commands use new lightning URLs
* Remove unused filter_name arg from Go to Record Home robot keyword.
* Fix metadata map for Settings.

2.0.8 (2018-08-21)
------------------
* Flows that are executed from within another flow now support task-level control flow.
* We no longer support the undocumented ability for a Flow to provide its own class_path.
* Use the connected app details to set a client name on HTTP requests to Salesforce.

2.0.7 (2018-08-16)
------------------
* `cci service show` has been renamed `cci service info`!
* Update default API version in the base YAML to v43.0.
* Doc updates in the tutorial, thanks to @justindonnaruma!
* Significant refactor of the cli module, including a bunch of small usability and exception handling changes. See https://github.com/SFDO-Tooling/CumulusCI/pull/708 for details.
* Display the file name for error causing files in more cases.
* Strip packageVersions tags from aura/, components/, and pages/ metadata.
* Update PyYAML dependency.

2.0.6 (2018-08-07)
------------------
* In Robot tests that use the standard keyword for interacting with a lookup field, we now wait for all AJAX requests to complete before submitting.
* Add unit tests for large sections of the library.
* We now support Flow, DuplicateRule, and other new Metadata types thanks to @carlosvl.
* Fixed refreshing oauth token when deploying metadata to persistent orgs.

2.0.5 (2018-08-01)
------------------

* Fixes #695: Update InstallPackageZipBuilder to set activateRSS to unblock installs.

2.0.4 (2018-07-30)
------------------

* Fixes #611: Scratch org operations were failing on Windows
* Fixes #664: Scratch org aliases incorrectly included double quotes in the alias name

2.0.3 (2018-07-27)
------------------

* Added support for waiting on Aura HTTP Requests to complete after a browser action is performed in selenium from the Robot Salesforce Library: http://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/robotframework.html#waiting-for-lightning-ui
* Github API client will now automatically retry on 502 errors
* Better error messages from parsing errors during package.xml generation which show the file causing the error

2.0.2 (2018-06-06)
------------------
* Bugfix: Update InstallPackageZipBuilder to use a recent api version to unblock installs.

2.0.1 (2018-06-06)
------------------
* Bugfix: Allow passing a connected app directly to OrgConfig.refresh_oauth_token.

2.0.0 (2018-06-01)
------------------

After over 19 months of development as alpha (40 version over 3 months) and beta (98 releases over 16 months) releases and over a year running production builds using CumulusCI, it's time to remove the "beta" label.

This marks the first production release of CumulusCI 2.x!

2.0.0-beta99 (2018-05-31)
-------------------------

* Ensure that github credentials are never shown in the log for github dependencies with unmanaged metadata

2.0.0-beta98 (2018-05-31)
-------------------------
**WARNING: This release introduces breaking changes to the syntax for flow definitions and to the default flows.  If you customized any of the default flows in your project or have defined custom flows, you will need to modify your cumulusci.yml file to work with this release.**

Changes default flows shipped with CumulusCI to a new syntax and structure taking advantage of the ability for flows to call other flows.  This allows flows to be modularized in ways that weren't possible when the original set of flows was designed.

* The **tasks:** section in cumulusci.yml for a flow is now renamed to **steps:**  A **FlowConfigError** will be raised if an old style flow definition is detected.  All existing flow customizations and custom flows need to be changed in the **cumulusci.yml** to avoid raising an exception.
* All default flows have been restructured.  Existing customizations of default flows likely need to be changed to adapt to the new structure.  In most cases, you will want to move your customizations to some of the new **config_*** or **deploy_*** instead of the main flows.
* **ci_beta_install** has been removed and replaced with **install_beta** and **uninstall_managed**  **install_beta** does not attempt to uninstall an existing version of the package.  If you need to uninstall the package first, use the **uninstall_managed** flow before running **install_beta**
* Added new **qa_org** flow to allow different configurations for dev vs QA orgs
* New modularized flows structure allows for easier and more reusable customization:

    * **dependencies** Runs the pre-package deployment dependency tasks **update_dependencies** and **deploy_pre**  This flow is called by almost all the main flows.
    * **config_*** flows provide a place to customize the package configuration for different environments.  These flows are called by the main flows after the package metadata is deployed or a managed version is installed.  Customizations to the config flows automatically apply to the main flows.

        * **config_apextest** Configure org for running apex tests
        * **config_dev** Configure org for dev use
        * **config_managed** Configure org with a managed package version installed
        * **config_packaging** Configure the packaging org
        * **config_qa** Configure org for QA use

    * **deploy_*** flows provide a place to customize how metadata deployments are done.  The deploy flows do more than just a simple deployment such as unscheduling scheduled jobs, rebuilding the package.xml, and incrementally deleting any stale metadata in the package from the org.

        * **deploy_unmanaged** Used to do a standard deployment of the unmanaged metadata
        * **deploy_packaging** Used to deploy to packaging.  Wraps the **create_managed_src** task around the deploy to inject metadata that can only be deployed to the packaging org
        * **deploy_unmanaged_ee** Used to deploy unmanaged metadata to an Enterprise Edition org using the **create_unmanaged_ee_src** task

* **github** dependencies can now point to a private Github repository.  All zip downloads from Github will pass the password (should be a personal access token) from the **github** service configured in the CumulusCI keychain.
* **GithubRelease**, **PushUpgradeRequest**, and **PackageUploadRequest** now track the release data as return values

2.0.0-beta97 (2018-05-31)
-------------------------
- Salesforce Connected App is now a CCI Service! Instead of using `cci org config_connected_app` you can use the familiar `cci service` commands.

- Add new task github_release_report to report info from GitHub release notes
- Add new flow dev_deploy for minimal deploy (tasks: unschedule_jobs, deploy)
- Enhance BaseFlow to be more easily subclassed/overridden/observed. Preserves task step number and adds several hook methods for subclasses (_pre_task, _post_task, _post_task_exception)
- Refactor github_release_notes task to use github3.py instead of calling the GitHub API directly. Includes these minor changes to functionality:
    - Cannot create release with this task (use github_create_release instead)
    - Merge existing release notes even when not publishing
- Fix issue that caused duplicate entries in the dependency tree
- Sort output of os.listdir in all occurrences. Guarantees ordered iteration over files on disk
- Validate CUMULUSCI_KEY value and raise more helpful exceptions if invalid

2.0.0-beta93 (2018-04-20)

* `cci org remove` will now attempt to first delete a scratch org if one was already created
* `cci org scratch` will prevent you from overwritting a scratch config that has already created a scratch org (which would create an orphaned scratch org) and direct you to use `cci org remove` instead.
* `cci org list` now shows the duration days, elapsed days, and if an org is expired.
* `cci org info` now shows the expiration date for scratch orgs
* All `cci` commands that update an org config will now attept to automatically recreate an expired scratch org

-------------------------

Breaking Changes
================

* If you created custom tasks off of `DeployNamespaced` or `DeployNamespacedBundles`, you will need to switch to using `Deploy` and `DeployBundles`.  The recommended configuration for such custom tasks is represented below.  In flows that need to inject the actual namespace prefix, override the `unmanaged` option .. ::

    custom_deploy_task:
        class_path: cumulusci.tasks.salesforce.Deploy
        options:
            path: your/custom/metadata
            namespace_inject: $project_config.project__package__namespace
            unmanaged: False

Enhancements
============

* The `cci` CLI will now check for new versions and print output at the top of the log if a new version is available
* The `cci` keychain now automatically creates orgs for all named scratch org configs in the project.  The orgs are created with the same name as the config.  Out of the box, CumulusCI comes with 4 org configs: `dev`, `feature`, `beta`, and `release`.  You can add additional org configs per project using the `orgs` -> `scratch` section of the project's `cumulusci.yml`.  With this change, `cci org list` will always show at least 4 orgs for any project.  If an org already exists in the keychain, it is not touched and no scratch org config is auto-created for that config.  The goal is to eliminate the need to call `cci org scratch` in most cases and make it easier for new users to get up and running with scratch orgs and CumulusCI.
* `cci org remove <org_name>` is now available to remove orgs from the keychain
* Scratch orgs created by CumulusCI are now aliased using the naming format `ProjectName__org_name` so you can easily run sfdx commands against scratch orgs created by CumulusCI
* `cci org list` now shows more information including `scratch`, `config_name`, and `username`.  NOTE: config_name will only be populated for newly created scratch configs.  You can use `cci org scratch` to recreate the config in the keychain.
* The new flow `dev_org_namespaced` provides a base flow for deploying unmanaged metadata into a namespaced org such as a namespaced scratch org
* All tasks which previously supported `namespace_inject` now support a new option, `namespaced_org`.  This option is designed to handle use cases of namespaced orgs such as a namespaced scratch org.  In namespaced orgs, all unmanaged metadata gets the namespace prefix even if it is not included in the package.  You can now use the `namespaced_org` option along with the file content token `%%%NAMESPACED_ORG%%%` and the file name token `___NAMESPACED_ORG___` to inject the namespace when deploying to a namespaced org.  `namespaced_org` defaults to False to be backwards compatible with previous functionality.
* New task `push_list` supports easily pushing a list of OrgIds via the Push API from the CLI: `cci task run push_list -o file <file_path> -o version 1.2 --org packaging`


2.0.0-beta64 (2017-09-29)
-------------------------

* Show proper exit status for failed tests in heroku_ci.sh
* Handle BrowserTestFailure in CLI

2.0.0-beta63 (2017-09-26)
-------------------------

* Documentation has been updated!
* CumulusCI now supports auto detection of repository information from CI environments.  This release includes an implementation for Heroku CI

2.0.0-beta62 (2017-09-19)
-------------------------

* cci now supports both namespaced and non-namespaced scratch org configurations in the same project.  The default behavior changes slightly with this release.  Before, if the `sfdx-project.json` had a namespace configured, all scratch orgs created via `cci org scratch` would get the namespace.  With the new functionality, all orgs would by default not have the namespace.  You can configure individual org configs in your project's `cumulusci.yml` file by setting `namespace: True` under `orgs -> scratch -> <org_name>`

2.0.0-beta61 (2017-09-12)
-------------------------

* Fix bug that was causing a forced token refresh with `sfdx force:org:open` at the start of a flow or task run against a freshly created scratch org.
* Add support for Big Objects with `__b` suffix in `update_package_xml` and `update_package_xml_managed`

-------------------------

* Add support for Platform Events with `__e` suffix in `update_package_xml` and `update_package_xml_managed`

2.0.0-beta59 (2017-09-06)
-------------------------

* `YamlProjectConfig` can now accept an `additional_yaml` keyword argument on initialization.  This allows a 5th level of layering to the `cumulusci.yml` config.  This change is not wired up to the CLI yet but is available for application built on top of cumulusci to use.
* `cumulusci.core.flow` and `cumulusci.core.keychain` now have 100% test coverage

2.0.0-beta58 (2017-08-29)
-------------------------

* Fix import error in `github_release_notes` task introduced in beta57

2.0.0-beta57 (2017-08-28)
-------------------------

* Task options can now dynamically reference attributes from the project_config using the syntax `$project_config.attr_name`.  For example, `$project_config.repo_branch` will resolve to the current branch when the task options are initialized.
* New task `github_parent_to_children` uses new functionality in `MergeBranch` to support merging from a parent feature branch (ex. `feature/parent`) into all child branches (ex. `feature/parent__child`).
* `github_master_to_feature` task will now skip child branches if their corresponding parent branch exists
* `ci_feature` flow now runs `github_parent_to_children` at the end of the flow
* Github task classes were restructured but the `class_path` used in `cumulusci.yml` remains the same
* New test coverage for github tasks

* Added integration with sentry.io

  * Use `cci service connect sentry` to enable the sentry service
  * All task execution exceptions will be logged as error events in sentry
  * `cci task run` and `cci flow run` will now show you the url to the sentry event if one was registered and prompt to open in a browser.

* New services registration support added by community contribution from @cdcarter

  * Services and their schemas can now be defined in the cumulusci.yml file.  See https://github.com/SFDO-Tooling/CumulusCI/issues/224 for more details until docs are fully updated
  * `cci services list`
  * `cci services show github`
  * `cci services connect github`

* Improved error handling for metadata deployment failures:

  * Metadata deployments now throw more specific errors when appropriate: MetadataComponentFailure, ApexTestFailure, or MetadataApiError
  * Output for each component failure on a deploy now includes more information such as the column number of the error

* `release_beta` now ignores errors in the `github_release_notes` process by default

2.0.0-beta12 (2017-02-02)
-------------------------

* Throw better exceptions if there are failures creating or deleting scratch orgs

2.0.0-beta11 (2017-02-01)
-------------------------

* Fixes and new functionality for `update_package_xml_managed` task.

  * Added support for project -> package -> name_managed in the cumulusci.yml file to specify a different package name to use when deploying to the packaging org.
  * Fixed bug with install_class and uninstall_class handling

2.0.0-beta10 (2017-01-20)
-------------------------

* Completed removed CumulusCI 1 code from the repository and egg.  The egg should be 17MB smaller now.
* Removed `cumulusci.tasks.ant.AntTask`.  Please replace any usage with `cumulusci.tasks.command.Command` or `cumulusci.tasks.command.SalesforceCommand`
* Removed the `update_meta_xml` task for now since it was the only task relying on Ant.  A new and much better Python based implementation will be coming soon.

2.0.0-beta9 (2017-01-20)
------------------------

* A few upgrades to the Command task:

  * No longer strip left side whitespace from output to preserve indentation
  * New method `_process_output` can be overridden to change how output lines are processed
  * New method `_handle_returncode` can be overridden to change how exit status is handled

2.0.0-beta8 (2017-01-19)
------------------------

* Added new task classes util.DownloadZip, command.SalesforceCommand, and command.SalesforceBrowserTestCommand that can be mapped in individual projects to configure browser tests or other commands run against a Salesforce org.  The commands are automatically passed a refreshed `SF_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `SF_INSTANCE_URL` environment variables.
* Added new CLI commands `cci project connect_saucelabs` and `cci project show_saucelabs`
* Added `ci_install_beta` flow that uninstalls the previous managed version then installs the latest beta without running apex tests
* Added new method cumulusci.utils.download_extract_zip to download and extract a zip including re-rooting the zip to a subfolder.
* All Salesforce tasks now delete any tempdirs they create to prevent wasting disk space

2.0.0-beta7 (2017-01-17)
------------------------

* `run_tests_debug` now ignores all non-test methods including any method decorated with @testSetup

2.0.0-beta6 (2017-01-17)
------------------------

* Return full info when a component failure occurs on a Metadata API deployment.  Previously only the problem was shown without context like file name and line number making it difficult to figure out what caused the failure.
* `run_tests_debug` now ignores the @testSetup method when parsing debug logs.  Previously it would throw an error if tests used @testSetup

2.0.0-beta5 (2017-01-16)
------------------------

* Fixes for the `unmanaged_ee` flow to fix a bug where avialableFields elements were not properly being stripped from fieldsSets in .object files

2.0.0-beta4 (2017-01-13)
------------------------

* Add `update_admin_profile` to all flows that deploy or install to a Salesforce org.  Note that this adjusted the task numbers in some flows so you should double check your project specific flow customizations.

2.0.0-beta3 (2017-01-13)
------------------------

* Remove `deploy_post_managed` task from the default `ci_master` flow.  Deploying the unpackaged/post content to the packaging org risks the spider accidentally including some of it in the package.  Projects that want to run `deploy_post_managed` against the packaging org can extend `ci_master` in their cumulusci.yml file to add it.

2.0.0-beta2 (2017-01-12)
------------------------

* Fix a bug in project_config.get_latest_version() with tags that don't match either the beta or release prefix.

2.0.0-alpha42 (2017-01-10)
--------------------------

* Metadata API calls now progressively wait longer between each status check to handle calls with long Pending times.  Each check also now outputs a line saying how long it will sleep before the next check.

2.0.0-alpha41 (2017-01-06)
--------------------------

* Fix bug in `uninstall_packaged_incremental` where the task would error out if no metadata was found to delete

2.0.0-alpha40 (2017-01-06)
--------------------------

* `uninstall_packaged_incremental` task now skips the deploy step if now metadata was found to be deleted

2.0.0-alpha39 (2017-01-06)
--------------------------

* Two new task classes exist for loading and deleting data via Bulk API.  Note that there are no default task mappings for these classes as the mappings should be project specific.  Define your own mappings in your project's cumulusci.yml file to use them.

  * **cumulusci.tasks.bulkdata.LoadData**: Loads relational data from a sqlite database into Salesforce objects using a yaml file for mapping
  * **cumulusci.tasks.bulkdata.DeleteData**: Deletes all records from specified objects in order of object list

* Added support for customPermissions
* Added new Command task that can be used to call arbitrary commands with configurable environment variables

2.0.0-alpha38 (2016-12-28)
--------------------------

* Scratch orgs now cache the org info locally during flow execution to prevent multiple calls out to the Heroku CLI that are unnecessary

* `run_tests_debug` now deletes existing TraceFlag objects in addition to DebugLevels
* Fix bug in `push_all` and `push_sandbox`
* Push tasks now use timezone for start_date option

2.0.0-alpha37 (2016-12-20)
--------------------------

* `github_release_notes` now correctly handles the situation where a merge commit's date can be different than the PR's merged_at date in Github by comparing commit sha's

2.0.0-alpha36 (2016-12-20)
--------------------------

* `github_release` now works with an existing tag/ref and sleeps for 3 seconds after creating the tag to allow Github time to catch up

2.0.0-alpha35 (2016-12-20)
--------------------------

* Remove `draft` option from `github_release` since the Github API doesn't support querying draft releases

2.0.0-alpha34 (2016-12-20)

2.0.0-alpha33 (2016-12-20)
--------------------------

* `github_release_notes` now raises an exception in `publish` mode if the release doesn't exist instead of attempting to create it.  Use `github_release` to create the release first before calling `github_release_notes`
* Fix a bug with dynamic task option lookup in flows

2.0.0-alpha32 (2016-12-19)
--------------------------

* Move logger configuration out of core and into CLI so other implementations can provide their own logger configurations
* Added `retry_interval` and `retry_interval_add` options to `install_beta` to introduce a progressive delay between retry attempts when the package is unavailable

2.0.0-alpha30 (2016-12-13)
--------------------------

* **IMPORANT** This release changes the yaml structure for flows.  The new structure now looks like this::

    flows:
        flow_name:
            tasks:
                1:
                    task: deploy
                2:
                    task: run_tests
