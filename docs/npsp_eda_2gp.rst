Extend NPSP and EDA with Second-Generation Packaging
-------------------------------------------------------

Building packages that extend (depend on) NPSP and EDA using second-generation packaging involves some unique complications.
Both NPSP and EDA have install-time dependencies on Record Type org features: an Account Record Type must exist in order
for the packages to install. 

When building first-generation packages, both NPSP and EDA serve this need by installing
unpackaged Record Types stored in their ``unpackaged/pre`` folders. However, second-generation packaging doesn't allow
interactive access to its build orgs, where package versions are created.

We recommend that projects which extend EDA or NPSP with a second-generation package use scratch org definition files to satisfy
these Record Type dependencies. You can do this by creating a new org definition file in ``orgs``, based on your existing org definitions,
and adding to it an ``objectSettings`` section. We'll call this file ``orgs/build.json``.

.. code-block:: json

    "settings": {
        /* Your project's settings are here */
    },
    "objectSettings": {
        "account": {
            "defaultRecordType": "default"
        }
    }
 

You'll also add to your `cumulusci.yml`:

.. code-block:: yaml

    orgs:
        scratch:
            build:
                config_file: orgs/build.json
 

Then, run your 2GP builds against the org `build`: 

.. code-block:: console

    $ cci flow run dependencies --org build
    $ cci flow run upload_2gp_beta --org build


This will result in the creation of default Record Types in the build org, allowing NPSP to be installed. Meanwhile,
your other scratch orgs will continue to use the NPSP or EDA default Record Types, installed by CumulusCI's 
dependency-management system and reflecting the configuration of the subscriber orgs into which your package 
will ultimately be installed.
