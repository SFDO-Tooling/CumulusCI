Custom Tasks via YAML
=====================

With just some simple changes in the cumulusci.yml file, you can override a lot of build functionality without ever touching any Python code.

Change directory for deploy task
--------------------------------

The global cumulusci.yml file that comes with cumulusci defines the `deploy` task with the following YAML::

    tasks:
        deploy:
            description: Deploys the src directory of the repository to the org
            class_path: cumulusci.tasks.salesforce.Deploy
            options:
                path: src

You can override the `path` option by adding the following to your project's cumulusci.yml file::

    tasks:
        deploy:
            options:
                path: some_other_dir

Swap out an Ant target for a task
---------------------------------
If we wanted to replace the following task with an ant target in our project::

    tasks:
        create_package:
            description: Creates a package in the target org with the default package name for the project
            class_path: cumulusci.tasks.salesforce.CreatePackage
            options:
                path: src

Swap out the create_package test to use an Ant target instead by adding the following to your project's cumulusci.yml::

    tasks:
        create_package:
            class_path: cumulusci.tasks.ant.AntTask
            options:
                target: createUnmanagedPackage

Now any flow in your project that calls the `create_package` task will run your `createUnmanagedPackage` Ant target instead.

Custom Flows via YAML
=====================

The main cumulusci.yml file defines the `dev_org` flow using the following YAML.  We'll use the `dev_org` flow for the flow customization examples::

    flows:
        dev_org:
            description: Deploys the unmanaged package metadata and all dependencies to the target org
            tasks:
                1:
                    task: create_package
                2:
                    task: update_dependencies
                3:
                    task: deploy_pre
                4:
                    task: deploy
                5:
                    task: uninstall_packaged_incremental
                6:
                    task: deploy_post

Customize vs Create
-------------------

A key philosophy of the user experience for CumulusCI is to keep things consistent from project to project while allowing for project specific customizations.  For example, the included `dev_org` allows a developer to run a complete deployment to set up a development environment.  Rather than each project defining its own `dev_org_myproject` flow, it's a better user experience to just customize the `dev_org` flow for projects that need something different.  This way, a developer switching from Project Repo A to Project Repo B can run the same command, `cci flow run dev_org` in each project instead of having to know the custom flow names for each project.

Add a task to the dev_org flow
------------------------------

If you want to also run the `update_admin_profile` task after the `uninstall_packaged_incremental` task, you would add the following to your project's cumulusci.yml::

    flows:
        dev_org:
            tasks:
                5.1:
                    - task: update_admin_profile

Skip a task in a flow
---------------------

If you never want to run the `uninstall_packaged_incremental` task, add the following to your project's cumulusci.yml::

    flows:
        dev_org:
            tasks:
                5:
                    - task: None

Rearrange two tasks in a flow
-----------------------------

If you wanted to run `deploy_pre` before `update_dependencies`, add the following to your project's cumulusci.yml::

    flows:
        dev_org:
            tasks:
                2:
                    - task: deploy_pre
                3:
                    - task: update_dependencies

Defining a new flow
-------------------

If you can't customize an out of the box flow or have a use case for which there is no out of the box flow, you can create your own project specific flows by adding the following structure to your cumulusci.yml::

    flows:
        my_custom_flow: # Name this whatever you want
            description: A custom flow for this project (put a better descriptions here please!)
            tasks:
                1:
                    task: deploy_pre
                2:
                    task: update_dependencies
                3:
                    task: deploy
                4:
                    task: update_admin_profile
                5:
                    task: run_tests


Custom tasks via Python
=======================

While the built in tasks are designed to be highly configurable via the cumulusci.yml and the task's options, sometimes an individual project needs to change the implementation of a task to meet its requirements.  This section shows a few examples custom tasks implemented in Python.

When the cci command runs, it adds your current repo's root to the python path.  This means you can write your python customizations to CumulusCI and store them in your project's repo along with your code.

All of the following examples assume that you've created a tasks module in your repo::
 
    mkdir tasks
    touch tasks/__init__.py

Quick background about CumulusCI tasks
--------------------------------------

All tasks in CumulusCI are python classes that subclass `cumulusci.core.tasks.BaseTask`.  The general usage of a task is two step: initialize an instance then call it to run the task.

For most tasks, you'll want to override the `_run_task` method in your subclass to provide implementation.

Query the Enterprise API for Data
---------------------------------

CumulusCI provides a number of base task classes that are useful for building completely custom tasks.  For this example, we'll use the `BaseSalesforceApiTask` which initializes the `simple-salesforce` python library for interacting with the Salesforce REST API.  `BaseSalesforceApiTask` sets `self.sf` to an initialized instance with the access token already set so you just focus on writing your API interaction logic.

Create the file `tasks/rest.py`::

    from cumulusci.core.tasks.salesforce import BaseSalesforceApiTask

    class ListContacts(BaseSalesforceApiTask):
        def _run_task(self):
            res = self.sf.query('Select Id, FirstName, LastName from Contact LIMIT 10')
            for contact in res['records']:
                self.logger.info('{Id}: {FirstName} {LastName}'.format(**contact))

To wire this task up to CumulusCI, add the following in your project's cumulusci.yml::

    tasks:
        list_contacts:
            description: Prints 10 Contacts
            class_path: tasks.rest.ListContacts

Verify that the task shows up::

    cci task list
    cci task info list_contacts
        

Query the Tooling API
---------------------

In this example, we'll use another API exposed by the `BaseSalesforceApiTask`, the Tooling API! The base task class initializes a wrapper to the enterprise api (`self.sf`), to the bulk api (`self.bulk`), and to the tooling api (`self.tooling`). With a modified `simple-salesforce` instance pointing to the tooling API, we can query for Apex Classes in our org.

Create the file `tasks/tooling.py`::

    from cumulusci.tasks.salesforce import BaseSalesforceApiTask

    class ListApexClasses(BaseSalesforceApiTask):
        def _run_task(self):
            res = self.tooling.query('Select Id, Name, NamespacePrefix from ApexClass LIMIT 10')
            for apexclass in res['records']:
                self.logger.info('{Id}: [{NamespacePrefix}] {Name}'.format(**apexclass))
    
To wire this task up to CumulusCI, add the following in your project's cumulusci.yml::

    tasks:
        list_classes:
            description: Prints 10 Apex Classes
            class_path: tasks.tooling.ListClasses

Verify that the task shows up::

    cci task list
    cci task info list_classes

Extend the default update_admin_profile task
--------------------------------------------

The previous examples showed how to add a completely new task, but what if we need to implement some custom project specific logic into an existing task?  For this example, we'll take a look at how the Salesforce.org Nonprofit Success Pack modifies the `update_admin_profile` task to grant FLS on custom fields added to a managed object and set the visibility and default values for project specific record types.

The following is the content of the `tasks/salesforce.py` file in the Cumulus repository::

    import os
    from cumulusci.tasks.salesforce import UpdateAdminProfile as BaseUpdateAdminProfile
    from cumulusci.utils import findReplace
    from cumulusci.utils import findReplaceRegex
    
    rt_visibility_template = """
    <recordTypeVisibilities>
        <default>{}</default>
        <personAccountDefault>true</personAccountDefault>
        <recordType>{}</recordType>
        <visible>true</visible>
    </recordTypeVisibilities>
    """
    
    class UpdateAdminProfile(BaseUpdateAdminProfile):
            
        def _process_metadata(self):
            super(UpdateAdminProfile, self)._process_metadata()
            
            # Strip record type visibilities
            findReplaceRegex(
                '<recordTypeVisibilities>([^\$]+)</recordTypeVisibilities>',
                '',
                os.path.join(self.tempdir, 'profiles'),
                'Admin.profile'
            )
            
            # Set record type visibilities
            self._set_record_type('Account.HH_Account', 'false')
            self._set_record_type('Account.Organization', 'true')
            self._set_record_type('Opportunity.NPSP_Default', 'true')
    
        def _set_record_type(self, name, default):
            rt = rt_visibility_template.format(default, name)
            findReplace(
                '<tabVisibilities>',
                '{}<tabVisibilities>'.format(rt),
                os.path.join(self.tempdir, 'profiles'),
                'Admin.profile',
                max=1,
            )

That's a lot of code, but it is pretty simple to explain:

* The standard UpdateAdminProfile class provides the `_process_metadata` method which modifies the retrieved Admin.profile before it is redeployed.  We want to add our logic after the standard logic does its thing.

* First, we strip out all `<recordTypeVisibilities>*</recordTypeVisibilities>` using the findReplaceRegex util method provided by CumulusCI

* Next, we set visibility on the 3 record types needed by the project and set the proper default record type values.

This then gets wired into the project's builds by the following in the cumulusci.yml::

    tasks:
        update_admin_profile:
            class_path: tasks.salesforce.UpdateAdminProfile
            options:
                package_xml: lib/admin_profile.xml

Note that here we're overriding the default package_xml used by UpdateAdminProfile.  The reason for this is taht we need to retrieve some managed objects that come from dependent packages so we can grant permissions on fields we added to those objects.  Here's the contents of `lib/admin_profile.xml`::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <Package xmlns="http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata">
        <types>

Continuous Integration with CumulusCI
=====================================

CircleCI
--------

Building a project configured for CumulusCI on CircleCI is fairly easy to get set up.  However, if you are using persistent DE orgs to build against, you will hit issues if you have more than one build container in your CircleCI account and two feature branch commits come in at about the same time.  CircleCI does not currently have a way to control build concurrency other than to restrict the number of containers to one.

First, set up your project in CircleCI and add the following Environment Variables in the project's config:

* CUMULUSCI_CONNECTED_APP: The output from `cci org connected_app`
* CUMULUSCI_ORG_feature: The output from `cci org info feature`, assuming you've already connected your feature org to your local toolbelt.
    

The following circle.yml file added to your repo will build all branches as unmanaged code::

    machine:
      python:
        version: 2.7.12
    environment:
      CUMULUSCI_KEYCHAIN_CLASS: cumulusci.core.keychain.EnvironmentProjectKeychain
    dependencies:
      override:
        - 'pip install --upgrade pip'
        - 'pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt'
    test:
      override:
        - 'cci flow run ci_feature_cumulus --org feature'
      post:
        - 'mkdir -p $CIRCLE_TEST_REPORTS/junit/'
        - 'cp test_results.xml $CIRCLE_TEST_REPORTS/junit/'

If you want to run the full packaging flow where feature branches build unmanaged and master branch commits build and test a beta managed package, you need to set the following environment variables in CircleCI:

* CUMULUSCI_ORG_packaging: The output from `cci org info packaging`, assuming you've already connected your packaging org to your local toolbelt.
* CUMULUSCI_ORG_beta: The output from `cci org info beta`, assuming you've already connected your beta org to your local toolbelt.
* CUMULUSCI_SERVICE_github: The output from `cci project show_github`, assuming you've already configured github locally via `cci project connect_github` 

Next, use the following circle.yml::

    machine:
      python:
        version: 2.7.12
      environment:
        CUMULUSCI_KEYCHAIN_CLASS: cumulusci.core.keychain.EnvironmentProjectKeychain
    dependencies:
      override:
        - 'pip install --upgrade pip'
        - 'pip install --upgrade cumulusci'
    test:
      pre:
        - 'if [[ $CIRCLE_BRANCH == "master" ]]; then cci flow run ci_master --org packaging; fi'
        - 'if [[ $CIRCLE_BRANCH == "master" ]]; then cci flow run release_beta --org packaging; fi'
      override:
        - 'if [[ $CIRCLE_BRANCH == "master" ]]; then cci flow run ci_beta --org beta; else cci flow run ci_feature --org feature; fi'
      post:
        - 'mkdir -p $CIRCLE_TEST_REPORTS/junit/'
        - 'cp test_results.xml $CIRCLE_TEST_REPORTS/junit/'
        - 'if [[ $CIRCLE_BRANCH != "master" ]]; then cp test_results.json $CIRCLE_ARTIFACTS; fi'
        #- 'if [[ $CIRCLE_BRANCH != "master" ]]; then cci task run apextestsdb_upload; fi'
    deployment:
      master_to_feature:
        branch: master
        commands:
          - 'cci task run github_master_to_feature'

Note that the beta upload flow requires pilot access to the PackageUploadRequest API.


CircleCI + Salesforce DX
------------------------

If you have Developer Preview access to Salesforce DX, you can use CumulusCI 2.0 to build against scratch orgs and allow for concurrent feature branch builds that automatically delete the scratch org at the end of the build.

You'll first need to setup some prerequirements:

* Ensure that orgs/dev.json contains a valid scratch org definition file
* Your project's workspace-config.json should have `"EnableTokenEncryption": false`
* Once encryption is disabled, authorize DX to your Environment Hub org
* Your packaging org should be connected to your keychain already, verify with `cci org info packaging`
* Run `cci org scratch dev` to create the configuration for the scratch org in your cci keychain.  You should be able to run `cci org info dev` to see the config.
* Run `cci org scratch beta` to create the configuration for the scratch org in your cci keychain.  You should be able to run `cci org info beta` to see the config.

Once your project is set up in CircleCI, add the following additional environment variables in addition to the ones listed above:

* CUMULUSCI_CONNECTED_APP: The output from `cci org connected_app`
* CUMULUSCI_ORG_feature: The output from `cci org info feature`, assuming you've already connected your feature org to your local toolbelt.
* SFDX_HUB_ORG: The contents of ~/.appcloud/hubOrg.json
* SFDX_CONFIG: The contents of ~/.appcloud/workspace_config.json

The following circle.yml in your project's root should get things going for unmanaged builds::

    machine:
      python:
        version: 2.7.12
      environment:
        CUMULUSCI_KEYCHAIN_CLASS: cumulusci.core.keychain.EnvironmentProjectKeychain
    dependencies:
      override:
        - 'pip install --upgrade pip'
        - 'pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt'
        - 'mkdir ~/.appcloud'
        - 'echo $SFDX_CONFIG > ~/.appcloud/workspace-config.json'
        - 'echo $SFDX_HUB_ORG > ~/.appcloud/hubOrg.json'
        - 'heroku plugins:install salesforce-alm@preview'
        - 'heroku force --help'
    test:
      override:
        - 'cci flow run ci_feature_cumulus --org feature --delete-org'
      post:
        - 'mkdir -p $CIRCLE_TEST_REPORTS/junit/'
        - 'cp test_results.xml $CIRCLE_TEST_REPORTS/junit/'

To run the full feature/master flow using scratch orgs for feature and beta test builds, set the following additional environment variables:

* CUMULUSCI_ORG_packaging: The output from `cci org info packaging`, assuming you've already connected your packaging org to your local toolbelt.
* CUMULUSCI_ORG_beta: The output from `cci org info beta`, assuming you've already connected your beta org to your local toolbelt.
* CUMULUSCI_SERVICE_github: The output from `cci project show_github`, assuming you've already configured github locally via `cci project connect_github` 

The following circle.yml should set up the whole feature/master flow using scratch orgs for feature and beta test builds::

    machine:
      python:
        version: 2.7.12
      environment:
        CUMULUSCI_KEYCHAIN_CLASS: cumulusci.core.keychain.EnvironmentProjectKeychain
    dependencies:
      override:
        - 'pip install --upgrade pip'
        - 'pip install --upgrade cumulusci'
        - 'mkdir ~/.appcloud'
        - 'echo $SFDX_CONFIG > ~/.appcloud/workspace-config.json'
        - 'echo $SFDX_HUB_ORG > ~/.appcloud/hubOrg.json'
        - 'heroku plugins:install salesforce-alm@preview'
        - 'heroku force --help'
    test:
      pre:
        - 'if [[ $CIRCLE_BRANCH == "master" ]]; then cci flow run ci_master --org packaging; fi'
        - 'if [[ $CIRCLE_BRANCH == "master" ]]; then cci flow run release_beta --org packaging; fi'
      override:
        - 'if [[ $CIRCLE_BRANCH == "master" ]]; then cci flow run ci_beta --org beta --delete-org; else cci flow run ci_feature --org feature --delete-org; fi'
      post:
        - 'mkdir -p $CIRCLE_TEST_REPORTS/junit/'
        - 'cp test_results.xml $CIRCLE_TEST_REPORTS/junit/'
        - 'if [[ $CIRCLE_BRANCH != "master" ]]; then cp test_results.json $CIRCLE_ARTIFACTS; fi'
        #- 'if [[ $CIRCLE_BRANCH != "master" ]]; then cci task run apextestsdb_upload; fi'
    deployment:
      master_to_feature:
        branch: master
        commands:
          - 'cci task run github_master_to_feature'
