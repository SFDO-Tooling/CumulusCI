    When importing, you can include one or more paths to python
    files that define page objects. For example, if you have a set
    of classes in robot/HEDA/resources/PageObjects.py, you can import
    this library into a test case like this:

    | Library  cumulusci.robotframework.PageObjects
    | ...  robot/HEDA/resources/PageObjects.py

    Page object classes need to use the @pageobject decorator from
    cumulusci.robotframework.pageobjects. The decorator takes two
    parameters: page_type and object_name. Both are arbitrary strings,
    but together should uniquely identify a collection of keywords for
    a page or objects on a page.

    Examples of page_type are Listing, Home, Detail, etc. Object types
    can be actual object types (Contact), custom object
    (Custom_object__c) or a logical name for a type of page (eg:
    AppointmentManager).

    Example:

    | from cumulusci.robotframework.pageobjects import BasePage
    | from cumulusci.robotframework.pageobjects import pageobject
    | ...
    | @pageobject(page_type="Detail", object_name="Custom__c")
