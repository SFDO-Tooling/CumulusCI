CumulusCI helps build great applications on the Salesforce platform by automating org setup, testing, and deployment for everyone â€” from developers and admins to testers and product managers.

**Best practices, proven at scale.** CumulusCI provides a complete development and release process created by Salesforce.org to build and release applications to thousands of users on the Salesforce platform. It's easy to start new projects with a standard set of tasks (single actions) and flows (sequences of tasks), or customize by adding your own.

**Batteries included.** Out-of-the-box features help you quickly:

* Build sophisticated orgs with automatic installation of dependencies.
* Load and capture sample datasets to make your orgs feel real.
* Apply transformations to existing metadata to tailor orgs to your specific requirements.
* Run builds in continuous integration systems.
* Create end-to-end browser tests and setup automation using `Robot Framework <https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/robotframework.html>`_.
* Generate synthetic data on any scale, from a single record to a million, using `Snowfakery <https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook.html#large-volume-data-synthesis-with-snowfakery>`__.

**Build anywhere.** Automation defined using CumulusCI is portable. It is stored in a source repository and can be run from your local command line, from a continuous integration system, or from a customer-facing MetaDeploy installer. CumulusCI can run automation on scratch orgs created using the Salesforce CLI, or on persistent orgs like sandboxes, production orgs, and Developer Edition orgs.
