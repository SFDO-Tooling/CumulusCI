CumulusCI is a command line tool belt and set of reusable Python classes useful in the development and release process of building a Salesforce Managed Package application.

Key Features
------------

* Out of the box, CumulusCI provides a complete best practice development and release process based on the processes used by Salesforce.org to build and release managed packages to thousands of users
* Flexible and pluggable system for running tasks (single actions) and flows (sequences of tasks)
* OAuth based org keychain allowing easy connection to Salesforce orgs and stored in local files using AES encryption

CumulusCI 1.0 (Ant based) Users, **PLEASE READ**
------------------------------------------------

The master branch now contains CumulusCI 2 which is not backwards compatible with the previous CumulusCI that was based on Ant. If you are using the Ant targets, please switch to using the `legacy-1.0` branch of the repository which contains the Ant based version. Or, consider upgrading to CumulusCI 2.
